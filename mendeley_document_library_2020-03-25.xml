There is no cure for COVID-19 and the vaccine development is estimated to require 12-18 months. Here we demonstrate a CRISPR-Cas13-based strategy, PAC-MAN (Prophylactic Antiviral CRISPR in huMAN cells), for viral inhibition that can effectively degrade SARS-CoV-2 sequences and live influenza A virus (IAV) genome in human lung epithelial cells. We designed and screened a group of CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) targeting conserved viral regions and identified functional crRNAs for cleaving SARS-CoV-2. The approach is effective in reducing respiratory cell viral replication for H1N1 IAV. Our bioinformatic analysis showed a group of only six crRNAs can target more than 90% of all coronaviruses. The PAC-MAN approach is potentially a rapidly implementable pan-coronavirus strategy to deal with emerging pandemic strains.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abdelmageed, Miysaa I.</author><author>Abdelmoneim, Abdelrahman Hamza</author><author>Mustafa, Mujahed I.</author><author>Elfadol, Nafisa M.</author><author>Murshed, Naseem S.</author><author>Shantier, Shaza W.</author><author>Makhawi, Abdelrafie M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Design of multi epitope-based peptide vaccine against E protein of human 2019-nCoV: An immunoinformatics approach</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.04.934232</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.04.934232</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Abdelmageed et al. - 2020 - Design of multi epitope-based peptide vaccine against E protein of human 2019-nCoV An immunoinformatics appr.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: on the late December 2019, a new endemic has been spread across Wuhan City, China; within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus designated as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization (WHO). In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak a public-health emergency of international concern due to the rapid spreading and increasing worldwide. There is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; therefore, the objective of this paper is to design a multi epitope peptide vaccine against 2019-nCoV using immunoinformatics approach. Method: We will highlight a technique facilitating the combination of immunoinformatics approach with comparative genomic approach to determine our potential target for designing the T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target. Results: Extensive mutations, insertion and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in 2019-nCoV strain; in addition, 10 MHC1 and MHC2 related peptides were promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99% respectively. Conclusion: T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine was designed for 2019-nCoV using envelope protein as an immunogenic target; nevertheless, the proposed T cell epitopes-based peptide vaccine rapidly needs to validates clinically to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile to assist on stopping this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adhikari, Sasmita Poudel</author><author>Meng, Sha</author><author>Wu, Yuju</author><author>Mao, Yuping</author><author>Ye, Ruixue</author><author>Wang, Qingzhi</author><author>Sun, Chang</author><author>Sylvia, Sean</author><author>Rozelle, Scott</author><author>Raat, Hein</author><author>Zhou, Huan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Literature Review of 2019 Novel Coronavirus During the Early Outbreak Period: Epidemiology, Causes, Clinical Manifestation and Diagnosis, Prevention and Control</title></titles><periodical/><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>causes</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>prevention and control</keyword><keyword>review</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Preprints</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.20944/PREPRINTS202002.0060.V1</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adiga, Aniruddha</author><author>Venkatramanan, Srinivasan</author><author>Peddireddy, Akhil</author><author>Telionis, Alex</author><author>Dickerman, Allan</author><author>Wilson, Amanda</author><author>Bura, Andrei</author><author>Warren, Andrew</author><author>Vullikanti, Anil</author><author>Klahn, Brian D</author><author>Mao, Chunhong</author><author>Xie, Dawen</author><author>Machi, Dustin</author><author>Raymond, Erin</author><author>Meng, Fanchao</author><author>Barrow, Golda</author><author>Baek, Hannah</author><author>Mortveit, Henning</author><author>Schlitt, James</author><author>Chen, Jiangzhuo</author><author>Walke, Jim</author><author>Goldstein, Joshua</author><author>Orr, Mark</author><author>Porebski, Przemyslaw</author><author>Beckman, Richard</author><author>Kenyon, Ron</author><author>Swarup, Samarth</author><author>Hoops, Stefan</author><author>Eubank, Stephen</author><author>Lewis, Bryan</author><author>Marathe, Madhav</author><author>Barrett, Chris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating the impact of international airline suspensions on COVID-19 direct importation risk</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.20.20025882</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.20.20025882</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Adiga et al. - 2020 - Evaluating the impact of international airline suspensions on COVID-19 direct importation risk.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Global airline networks play a key role in the global importation of emerging infectious diseases. Detailed information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. In this paper, we use a well-established metric known as effective distance on the global air traffic data from IATA to predict COVID-19 times of arrival (ToA) for different countries as a consequence of direct importation from China. Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO, we provide estimated ToA for all other countries. By combining effective distance with a measure for the country's vulnerability (Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI)), we propose a metric to rank vulnerable countries at immediate risk of case emergence. We then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries.

Cities outside Hubei are also facing great challenge and require implementing of effective and feasible strategy in precision diagnosing novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). We described a multicenter prospective study on diagnostic strategy of suspected NCP patients from January 22nd to February 9th, 2020 in Eastern China cities. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the patients. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory assessments, and computed tomographic (CT) scans were obtained. Pathogen screen were performed including RT-PCR, multiplex PCR, rapid flu antigen tests and mNGS. We enrolled 53 suspected NCP patients, among whom 20 were laboratory-confirmed. Fourteen (70%) and 3 (15%) patients were positive for the first and second SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. All NCP patients were positive for mNGS. Chest CT images and the symptoms of early stage NCP patients were similar to other viral pneumonia patients. We identified 11 of 20 co-infections in NCP cases, including regular respiratory virus, fungi and bacteria synchronously. Genomic analysis showed that 8 of 10 cases had no mutation in virus genome, while 2 cases had only one single mutation in N gene. Our study discovered that a combination of chest CT, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and multi-plex PCR is recommended in regions outside Hubei province. Co-infection of other pathogens with SARS-CoV-2 exists and should be acknowledged. Repeated sampling, change of specimen type or metagenomics sequencing could further facilitate during critical clinical cases.

Methods We included 102 confirmed COVID-19 cases hospitalized in Xiangyang No.1 peoples hospital, Hubei, China until Feb 9th, 2020. Demographic data, laboratory findings and chest computed tomographic (CT) images were obtained and analyzed. Findings All cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, including 52 males and 50 females with a mean age of 50.38 years (SD 16.86). Incubation time ranged from one to twenty days with a mean period of 8.09 days (SD 4.99). Fever (86[84.3%] of 102 patients), cough (58[57%]), fatigue (28[27%]), shortness of breath (24[23%]), diarrhea (15[15%]), expectoration (13[12%]), inappetence (11[10%]) were common clinical manifestations. We observed a decreased blood leukocyte count and lymphopenia in 21 (20.6%) and 56 (54.9%) patients, respectively. There were 66 (68%) of 97 patients with elevated C-reactive protein levels and 49 (57.6%) of 85 with increased erythrocytes sedimentation rate. Higher levels of procalcitonin and ferritin were observed in 19 (25.3%) of 75 and 12 (92.3%) of 13 patients, respectively. Eight patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), six developed respiratory failure, three had multiple organ failure and three died. The cumulative positivity rate over three rounds of real-time RT-PCR was 96%. One-hundred patients were found with typical radiological abnormalities in two rounds of chest CT scans, indicating a 98% consistency with real-time RT-PCR results. Interpretation Most COVID-19 patients in Xiangyang were secondary cases without sex difference, and the rate of severe cases and death was low. Middle-to-old-age individuals were more susceptible to the virus infection and the subsequent development of severe/fatal consequences. The average incubation period was longer among our patients. We recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks. Three times real-time RT-PCR plus two times CT scans is a practical clinical diagnosis strategy at present and should be used to increase the accuracy of diagnosis, thereby controlling the source of infection more effectively.

We examined the effects of population outflow from Wuhan on the 2019-nCoV transmission in other provinces and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan. We observed a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of cases. Further analysis revealed that if the city closure policy was implemented two days earlier, 1420 (95% CI: 1059, 1833) cases could be prevented, and if two days later, 1462 (95% CI: 1090, 1886) more cases would be possible. Our findings suggest that population movement might be one important trigger of the 2019-nCoV infection transmission in China, and the policy of city closure is effective to prevent the epidemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe appreciated the support by National Key R&amp;amp;D Program of China (Grant No: 2018YFA0606200).

The number of confirmed cases is increasing daily and reached 34,598 on 8 February 2020. In the current study, we present a new forecasting model to estimate and forecast the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the upcoming ten days based on the previously confirmed cases recorded in China. The proposed model is an improved adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using an enhanced flower pollination algorithm (FPA) by using the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). In general, SSA is employed to improve FPA to avoid its drawbacks (i.e., getting trapped at the local optima). The main idea of the proposed model, called FPASSA-ANFIS, is to improve the performance of ANFIS by determining the parameters of ANFIS using FPASSA. The FPASSA-ANFIS model is evaluated using the World Health Organization (WHO) official data of the outbreak of the COVID-19 to forecast the confirmed cases of the upcoming ten days. More so, the FPASSA-ANFIS model is compared to several existing models, and it showed better performance in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), Root Mean Squared Relative Error (RMSRE), coefficient of determination ( R 2 ), and computing time. Furthermore, we tested the proposed model using two different datasets of weekly influenza confirmed cases in two countries, namely the USA and China. The outcomes also showed good performances.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Asymptomatic coronavirus infection: MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)</title><secondary-title>Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease</full-title></periodical><pages>101608</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Travel Med Infect Dis</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101608</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1477893920300752</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alam, Intikhab</author><author>Kamau, Allan K</author><author>Kulmanov, Maxat</author><author>Arold, Stefan T</author><author>Pain, Arnab T</author><author>Gojobori, Takashi</author><author>Duarte, Carlos M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Functional pangenome analysis provides insights into the origin, function and pathways to therapy of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.17.952895</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.17.952895</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Alam et al. - 2020 - Functional pangenome analysis provides insights into the origin, function and pathways to therapy of SARS-CoV-2 cor.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: Recent epidemic of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a rising global health emergency that demands urgent analysis of its genome and solutions for detection and therapy. Methods: We used a comparative pangenomic analysis of Betacoronavirus sequenced thus far to detect the core and accessory gene clusters of this genus including SARS-CoV-2. We then annotate the functions, which are confirmed by structural analysis, and predict the potential location within the host cells of these proteins. Findings: We found five accessory gene clusters common to the SARS clade, including SARS-CoV-2, that perform functions supporting their pathogenicity. Phylogenetic analysis showed one of the accessory gene clusters, the protein E, to be present across the inferred evolutionary pathway of the SARS clade, including that of the horseshoe bat virus (Hp-betacoronavirus/Zhejiang2013), inferred to be the parental member of the clade. The E protein is highly conserved in the clade, differing between SARS and SARS-Cov2 with a difference of single amino acid substitution and a single amino acid insertion present in SARS but absent from SARS-CoV-2. Betacoronavirus pangenomedb is available at http://pangenomedb.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa. Interpretation: The characterization and functional assessment of SARS-CoV-2 envelope, E, protein in gene cluster 6, together with previous findings on this protein for SARS, leads us to recommend that detection of COVID-2019 be developed based on the SARS-CoV-2 E protein and that treatment using mutated SARS-Cov-2 lacking the E protein be explored as a promising candidate for a vaccine.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Albulescu, Claudiu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Coronavirus and financial volatility: 40 days of fasting and fear</title><secondary-title>arXiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>arXiv</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04005</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>40 days after the start of the international monitoring of COVID-19, we search for the effect of official announcements regarding new cases of infection and death ratio on the financial markets volatility index (VIX).

However, the vast majority of reported infections have occurred in China. To assess the effect of early travel restrictions adopted by the health authorities in China, we have implemented an epidemic metapopulation model that is fed with mobility data corresponding to 2019 and 2020. This allows to compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. Our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions are an effective measure in the short term, however, ii) they are ineffective when it comes to completely eliminate the disease. The latter is due to the impossibility of removing the risk of seeding the disease to other regions. Our study also highlights the importance of developing more realistic models of behavioral changes when a disease outbreak is unfolding. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement YM acknowledges partial support from the Government of Aragon, Spain through grant E36-17R (FENOL), and by MINECO and FEDER funds (FIS2017-87519-P).

While China - were the outbreak started - seems to have been able to contain the growth of the epidemic, different outbreaks are nowadays being detected in multiple countries. Much is currently unknown about the natural history of the disease, such as a possible asymptomatic spreading or the role of age in both the susceptibility and mortality of the disease. Nonetheless, authorities have to take action and implement contention measures, even if not everything is known. To facilitate this task, we have studied the effect of different containment strategies that can be put into effect. Our work specifically refers to the situation in Spain as of February 28th, 2020, where a few dozens of cases have been detected. We implemented an SEIR-metapopulation model that allows tracing explicitly the spatial spread of the disease through data-driven stochastic simulations. Our results are in line with the most recent recommendations from the World Health Organization, namely, that the best strategy is the early detection and isolation of individuals with symptoms, followed by interventions and public recommendations aimed at reducing the transmissibility of the disease, which although not efficacious for disease eradication, would produce as a second-order effect a delay of several days in the raise of the number of infected cases

The placing of entire cities in ‘lockdown’ directly affects urban economies on a multi-lateral level, including from social and economic standpoints. This is being emphasised as the outbreak gains ground in other countries, leading towards a global health emergency, and as global collaboration is sought in numerous quarters. However, while effective protocols in regard to the sharing of health data is emphasised, urban data, on the other hand, specifically relating to urban health and safe city concepts, is still viewed from a nationalist perspective as solely benefiting a nation’s economy and its economic and political influence. This perspective paper, written one month after detection and during the outbreak, surveys the virus outbreak from an urban standpoint and advances how smart city networks should work towards enhancing standardization protocols for increased data sharing in the event of outbreaks or disasters, leading to better global understanding and management of the same.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Web Page">16</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Althaus, CL</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating case fatality ratio of COVID-19 from observed cases outside China</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls><web-urls><url>https://github.com/calthaus/ncov-cfr/blob/master/README.md</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;report;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amodio, Emanuele</author><author>Vitale, Francesco</author><author>Cimino, Livia</author><author>Casuccio, Alessandra</author><author>Tramuto, Fabio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Outbreak of Novel Coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2): First Evidences From International Scientific Literature and Pending Questions</title><secondary-title>Healthcare</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Healthcare</full-title></periodical><pages>51</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Healthcare (Basel)</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/healthcare8010051</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/8/1/51</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>On 31 December, 2019, a cluster of 27 pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was reported by Chinese health authorities in Wuhan City (China) [...]</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>An, Ping</author><author>Chen, Hongbin</author><author>Jiang, Xiaoda</author><author>Su, Juan</author><author>Yijuan, Yong Xiao</author><author>Haixia, Ding</author><author>Mengyao, Ren</author><author>Chen, Ji Yifei</author><author>Chen, Wei</author><author>Lv, Xiaoguang</author><author>Shen, Lei</author><author>Chen, Mingkai</author><author>Li, Jiao</author><author>Yin, Anning</author><author>Kang, Jian</author><author>Liu, Shuzhong</author><author>Tan, Wei</author><author>Wu, Lianlian</author><author>Dong, Weiguo</author><author>Cao, Jiwang</author><author>Zhou, Zhongyin</author><author>Tan, Shiyun</author><author>Chen, Guozhong</author><author>Zhou, Jing</author><author>Yang, Yanning</author><author>Yu, Honggang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical features of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia presented gastrointestinal symptoms but without fever onset</title><secondary-title>The Lancet</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet</full-title></periodical><keywords/><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ssrn.com/abstract=3532530</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anastassopoulou, Cleo</author><author>Russo, Lucia</author><author>Tsakris, Athanasios</author><author>Siettos, Constantinos</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Data-Based Analysis, Modelling and Forecasting of the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.11.20022186</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.11.20022186</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Anastassopoulou et al. -

Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data (WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC and DXY) for Hubei from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters, i.e. the basic reproduction number (R0) and the infection, recovery and mortality rates, along with their 90% confidence intervals. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, we have repeated the calculations under a scenario that considers five times the number of confirmed infected cases and eight times the number of recovered. Our computations and analysis were based on a mean field Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIRD) model. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be 2.5, while the one computed by the official counts of the confirmed cases from the 11th of January until the 18th of January was found to be 4.6. Furthermore, on the estimated parameters from both scenarios, we provide tentative three-week forecasts of the evolution of the outbreak at the epicenter. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the cumulative number of infected will surpass 68,000 (as a lower bound) and could reach 140,000 (with an upper bound of 290,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of current data and estimations on the official count of infected people in the population, the death toll might exceed 7,000 by February 29; however, our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the mortality rate to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but also a high underestimation of the number of infected and recovered people in the population, which will hopefully lower the death toll.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding was receivedAuthor DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

It is still early days, but using existing data we develop a large ensemble of ecological niche models that project monthly variation in climate suitability of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus throughout a typical climatological year. The current spread suggests a degree of climate determination with Coronavirus displaying preference for cool and dry conditions. The predecessor SARS-CoV was linked to similar climate conditions. Should the spread of SARS CoV-2 continue to follow current trends, a worst-case scenario of synchronous global pandemic is improbable. More probable is the emergence of asynchronous seasonal global outbreaks much like other respiratory diseases. People in temperate warm and cold climates are more vulnerable. Those in arid climates follow next in vulnerability, while the disease will likely marginally affect the tropics. Our projections minimize uncertainties related with spread of SARS CoV-2, providing critical information for anticipating the adequate social, economic and political responses.

Using the travel history and symptom onset of 88 confirmed cases that were detected outside Wuhan in the early outbreak phase, we estimate the mean incubation period to be 6.4 days (95% credible interval: 5.6-7.7), ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percen-tile). These values should help inform 2019-nCoV case definitions and appropriate quarantine durations. Early January 2020, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the infectious agent causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, where the first cases had their symptom onset in December 2019 [1]. This newly discovered virus, which causes severe acute respiratory disease, is related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, but distinct from each of these [2]. The key epidemiological parameters, including incubation period, for this new virus are therefore rapidly being studied from incoming case reports as the epidemic continues. Chief among these key parameters is the incubation period distribution. The range of the values for the incubation period is essential to epidemiological case definitions, and is required to determine the appropriate duration of quarantine. Moreover, knowledge of the incubation period helps to assess the effectiveness of entry screening and contact tracing. The distribution of the incubation period is also used in estimating the size of the epidemic [3-5] and the transmission potential [6,7]. In absence of data on the 2019-nCoV incubation period, these studies have assumed incubation periods of SARS or MERS coronaviruses. Here we present the distribution of incubation periods estimated for travellers from Wuhan with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in the early outbreak phase, using their reported travel histories and symptom onset dates. Travellers from Wuhan with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus infection, reported symptom onset data and reported travel history In January 2020, an increasing number of cases confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV were detected outside Wuhan. For 88 cases detected between 20 and 28 January, the travel history (to and) from Wuhan is known, as well as their symptom onset date. Their ages range from 2 to 72 years of age (information missing for four cases); 31 were female and 57 were male. During this initial stage of the epidemic, it is most likely that these travellers were infected in Wuhan. Consequently, their time spent in Wuhan can be taken as the duration of exposure to infection. Of these 88 cases with known travel history, 63 were Wuhan residents who travelled elsewhere and 25 were visitors who stayed in Wuhan for a limited time. By taking the date of symptom onset and travel history together, we inferred the possible incubation period for each of these cases. Using the duration of stay in Wuhan and the symptom onset date, we obtained a range of possible values for the incubation period of each case.

We used a Bayesian approach to fitting that allows for the use of prior knowledge to inform the analysis.

As of 24:00 on February 2nd, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Hubei Province has reached up to 11,177. In this paper, we select the epidemic situation in Hubei Province as the research object to establish the SEIQDR model of infectious diseases. The parameters are determined from the existing data to predict the trend of the cumulative number of confirmed diagnoses, and the parameters are adjusted according to the prevention and control measures as well as possible changes. In comparison with Guangdong Province, where the SARS epidemic originated, it was concluded that the new coronavirus epidemic far exceeds the SARS epidemic in terms of infection rate and deaths. But thanks to the timely and effective prevention and control measures taken by the country, currently the epidemic is under control, and we predict the end of the epidemic is about 60 days earlier than the SARS virus. The total number of confirmed diagnoses in Hubei Province is 26,701 (ranges from 24,355 to 32,406), and the rapid growth period is expected to be from January 27th to February 10, and the epidemic will grow slowly after February 22nd. The growth is expected to stop on March 30th (ranges from March 26th to April 19th).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bajema, Kristina L.</author><author>Oster, Alexandra M.</author><author>McGovern, Olivia L.</author><author>Lindstrom, Stephen</author><author>Stenger, Mark R.</author><author>Anderson, Tara C.</author><author>Isenhour,, Cheryl</author><author>Clarke, Kevin R.</author><author>Evans, Mary E.</author><author>Chu, Victoria T.</author><author>Biggs, Holly M.</author><author>Kirking, Hannah L.</author><author>Gerber, Susan I.</author><author>Hall, Aron J.</author><author>Fry, Alicia M.</author><author>Oliver, Sara E.</author><author>Abedi, Glen</author><author>Bower, William</author><author>Chatham-Stephens, Kevin</author><author>Conklin, Laura</author><author>Cooley, Laura</author><author>Cortese, Margaret</author><author>Curns, Aaron</author><author>Dooling, Kathleen</author><author>Gokhale, Runa</author><author>Gold, Jeremy</author><author>Grant, Gavin</author><author>Gutman, Julie</author><author>Hesse, Elisabeth</author><author>Kamili, Shifaq</author><author>Kim, Lindsay</author><author>Kirkcaldy, Robert</author><author>Koumans, Emily</author><author>Kujawski, Stephanie</author><author>Langley, Gayle</author><author>Lively, Joana</author><author>Lu, Xiaoyan</author><author>Lynch, Brian</author><author>Lyss, Sheryl</author><author>Malapati, Lakshmi</author><author>Martin, Michael</author><author>Mbaeyi, Sarah</author><author>McClung, Paul</author><author>Midgley, Claire</author><author>Miller, Maureen</author><author>Morales, Michelle</author><author>Murray, Janna'</author><author>Parker Fiebelkorn, Amy</author><author>Patel, Manisha</author><author>Peacock, Georgina</author><author>Pierce, Taran</author><author>Rha, Brian</author><author>Sakthivel, Senthilkumar</author><author>Schneider, Eileen</author><author>Siegel, David A.</author><author>Sunshine, Brittany</author><author>Wallace, Megan</author><author>Wang, Lijuan</author><author>Watson, John</author><author>Whitaker, Brett</author><author>Yousaf, Anna</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Persons Evaluated for 2019 Novel Coronavirus — United States, January 2020</title><secondary-title>MMWR.

Occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. This can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. Understanding which occupational groups are exposed to infection and disease in the workplace can help to inform public health risk response and management for COVID-19, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks. Methods: To estimate the burden of United States workers exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by Standard Occupational Classification) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with BLS O*NET survey data, which ranks occupations with particular physical, ergonomic, and structural exposures. For this analysis, occupations reporting exposure to infection or disease more than once a month was the focus. Results: Based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 M) of United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week. Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. While the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers. These include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair). Conclusions: The large number of persons employed in a wide variety of occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for COVID-19. This work also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve.

Reproductive number (R) is an outbreak metric estimating the transmission of a pathogen. Initial R values were published based on the early outbreak in China with limited number of cases with whole genome sequencing. Initial comparisons failed to show a direct relationship viral genomic diversity and epidemic severity was not established for SARS-Cov-2. Methods: Each country's COVID-19 outbreak status was classified according to epicurve stage (index, takeoff, exponential, decline). Instantaneous R estimates (Wallinga and Teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval examined asymptomatic spread. Whole genome sequences were used to quantify the pathogen genome identity score that were used to estimate transmission time and epicurve stage. Transmission time was estimated based on evolutionary rate of 2 mutations/month. Findings: The country-specific R revealed variable infection dynamics between and within outbreak stages. Outside China, R estimates revealed propagating epidemics poised to move into the takeoff and exponential stages. Population density and local temperatures had variable relationship to the outbreaks. GENI scores differentiated countries in index stage with cryptic transmission. Integration of incidence data with genome variation directly increases in cases with increased genome variation. Interpretation: R was dynamic for each country and during the outbreak stage. Integrating the outbreak dynamic, dynamic R, and genome variation found a direct association between cases and genome variation. Synergistically, GENI provides an evidence-based transmission metric that can be determined by sequencing the virus from each case. We calculated an instantaneous country-specific R at different stages of outbreaks and formulated a novel metric for infection dynamics using viral genome sequences to capture gaps in untraceable transmission. Integrating epidemiology with genome sequencing allows evidence-based dynamic disease outbreak tracking with predictive evidence.

Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high risk conditions or their longer term background (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts. Methods: Using population based linked primary and secondary care electronic health records in England (HDR UK - CALIBER), we report the prevalence of underlying conditions defined by UK Public Health England COVID-19 guidelines (16 March 2020) in 3,862,012 individuals aged ≥30 years from 1997-2017. We used previously validated phenotypes, openly available (https://caliberresearch.org/portal), for each condition using ICD-10 diagnosis, Read, procedure and medication codes. We estimated the 1-year mortality in each condition, and developed simple models of excess COVID-19-related deaths assuming relative risk (RR) of the impact of the emergency (compared to background mortality) of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0. Findings: 20.0% of the population are at risk according to current PHE guidelines, of which; 13.7% were age&gt;70 years and 6.3% aged ≤70 years with ≥1 underlying condition (cardiovascular disease (2.3%), diabetes (2.2%), steroid therapy (1.9%), severe obesity (0.9%), chronic kidney disease (0.6%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD (0.5%). Multimorbidity (co-occurrence of ≥2 conditions in an individual) was common (10.1%). The 1-year mortality in the at-risk population was 4.46%, and age and underlying conditions combine to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions (5.9% in age&gt;70 years, 8.6% for COPD and 13.1% in those with ≥3 or more conditions). In a suppression scenario (at SARS CoV2 rates of 0.001% of the UK population), there would be minimal excess deaths (3 and 7 excess deaths at relative risk, RR, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 10% of the UK population (mitigation) the model estimates the numbers of excess deaths as: 13791, 34479 and 68957 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0 respectively). At SARS CoV2 rates of 80% in the UK population (do-nothing), the model estimates the number of excess deaths as 110332, 275,830 and 551,659 (at RR 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0) respectively. Interpretation: We provide the public, researchers and policy makers a simple model to estimate the excess mortality over 1 year from COVID-19, based on underlying conditions at different ages. If the relative mortality impact of COVID-19 were to be about 20% (similar magnitude as the established winter vs summer mortality excess), then the excess deaths would be 0 when 1 in 100 000 (suppression), 13791 when 1 in 10 (mitigation) and 110332 when 8 in 10 are infected (do nothing) scenario. However, the relative impact of COVID-19 is unknown. If the emergency were to double the mortality risk, then we estimate 7, 68957 and 551,659 excess deaths in the same scenarios. These results may inform the need for more stringent suppression measures as well as efforts to target those at highest risk for a range of preventive interventions.

Using global line-list data on COVID-19 cases reported until 29th February 2020 and global gridded temperature data, and after adjusting for surveillance capacity and time since first imported case, higher average temperature was strongly associated with lower COVID-19 incidence for temperatures of 1°C and higher. However, temperature explained a relatively modest amount of the total variation in COVID-19 incidence. These preliminary findings support stringent containment efforts in Europe and elsewhere.

Recently, it has been reported that discharged patients in China and elsewhere were testing positive after recovering. However, it remains unclear whether the convalescing patients have a risk of &quot;relapse&quot; or &quot;reinfection&quot;. The longitudinal tracking of re-exposure after the disappeared symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys was performed in this study. We found that weight loss in some monkeys, viral replication mainly in nose, pharynx, lung and gut, as well as moderate interstitial pneumonia at 7 days post-infection (dpi) were clearly observed in rhesus monkeys after the primary infection. After the symptoms were alleviated and the specific antibody tested positively, the half of infected monkeys were rechallenged with the same dose of SARS-CoV-2 strain. Notably, neither viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs along timeline nor viral replication in all primary tissue compartments at 5 days post-reinfection (dpr) was found in re-exposed monkeys. Combined with the follow-up virologic, radiological and pathological findings, the monkeys with re-exposure showed no recurrence of COVID-19, similarly to the infected monkey without rechallenge. Taken together, our results indicated that the primary SARS-CoV-2 infection could protect from subsequent exposures, which have the reference of prognosis of the disease and vital implications for vaccine design.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bao, Linlin</author><author>Deng, Wei</author><author>Huang, Baoying</author><author>Gao, Hong</author><author>Ren, Lili</author><author>Wei, Qiang</author><author>Yu, Pin</author><author>Xu, Yanfeng</author><author>Liu, Jiangning</author><author>Qi, Feifei</author><author>Qu, Yajin</author><author>Wang, Wenling</author><author>Li, Fengdi</author><author>Lv, Qi</author><author>Xue, Jing</author><author>Gong, Shuran</author><author>Liu, Mingya</author><author>Wang, Guanpeng</author><author>Wang, Shunyi</author><author>Zhao, Linna</author><author>Liu, Peipei</author><author>Zhao, Linna</author><author>Ye, Fei</author><author>Wang, Huijuan</author><author>Zhou, Weimin</author><author>Zhu, Na</author><author>Zhen, Wei</author><author>Yu, Haisheng</author><author>Zhang, Xiaojuan</author><author>Song, Zhiqi</author><author>Guo, Li</author><author>Chen, Lan</author><author>Wang, Conghui</author><author>Wang, Ying</author><author>Wang, Xinmin</author><author>Xiao, Yan</author><author>Sun, Qiangming</author><author>Liu, Hongqi</author><author>Zhu, Fanli</author><author>Ma, Chunxia</author><author>Yan, Lingmei</author><author>Yang, Mengli</author><author>Han, Jun</author><author>Xu, Wenbo</author><author>Tan, Wenjie</author><author>Peng, Xiaozhong</author><author>Jin, Qi</author><author>Wu, Guizhen</author><author>Qin, Chuan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Pathogenicity of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in hACE2 Transgenic Mice</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.07.939389</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.07.939389</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>2019-nCoV caused pneumonia cases in China has become a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).

RT-qPCR testing of respiratory secretions is routinely used to detect causative viruses in acute respiratory infection. RT-qPCR in-house protocols to detect the SARS-CoV-2 have been described. Validations of these protocols are considered a key knowledge gap for COVID-19, especially if executed in a high throughput format. Here, we investigate the analytical sensitivity and specificity of two interim RT-qPCR protocols for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 executed in a fully automated platform. Under our conditions, the N1 and RdRP (modified) showed the highest analytical sensitivity for their RNA targets. E assay, in its original concentration, was considered a tertiary confirmatory assay. Taken together, N1, RdRP (optimized) and E presented appropriated analytical sensibility and specificity in our automated RT-qPCR workflow for COVID-19 virus, E being at least 4-fold less sensitive than the others. This study highlights the importance of local validation of in-house assays before its availability to the population. The use of the synthetic RT-qPCR target to investigate novel assays diagnostic parameters in automated workflows is a quick, simple effective way to be prepared for upcoming threats. The proposed assay detected the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Brazilian Central-West.

Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect virulence-related genes in novel agents, as we show here for the 2019-nCoV coronavirus, unknown before it caused a pneumonia outbreak in December 2019.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baruah, V</author><author>Bose, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Immunoinformatics-aided identification of T cell and B cell epitopes in the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>Journal of medical virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of medical virology</full-title></periodical><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>epitope prediction</keyword><keyword>immunoinformatics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0146-6615</isbn><accession-num>32022276</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jmv.25698</electronic-resource-num><notes>1096-9071

This study took an immunoinformatics approach to identify significant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and B cell epitopes in the 2019-nCoV surface glycoprotein. Also, interactions between identified CTL epitopes and their corresponding MHC class I supertype representatives prevalent in China were studied by molecular dynamics simulations. We identified five CTL epitopes, three sequential B cell epitopes and five discontinuous B cell epitopes in the viral surface glycoprotein. Also, during simulations, the CTL epitopes were observed to be binding MHC class I peptide-binding grooves via multiple contacts, with continuous hydrogen bonds and salt bridge anchors, indicating their potential in generating immune responses. Some of these identified epitopes can be potential candidates for development of 2019-nCoV vaccines. This article is protected by copyright.

In our present study, an epitope-based peptide vaccine against nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus, using a combination of B cell and T cell epitope predictions, followed by molecular docking methods are performed. Here, protein sequences of homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part of protein. From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR from the region ranging from 38-47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions of 76-90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. Furthermore, this predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG interacted with MHC allelic proteins HLA-A*01:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01 respectively with the low IC50 values. These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores -725.0 Kcal/mole and -786.0 Kcal/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding. This MHC restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population coverage. This MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population also. Therefore, the epitopes IRNTTNPSAR and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG may be considered as potential peptides for peptide-based vaccine for coronavirus after further experimental study.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Batista, Milan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimation of the final size of the coronavirus epidemic by the logistic model</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.16.20023606</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.16.20023606</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Batista - 2020 - Estimation of the final size of the coronavirus epidemic by the logistic model.pdf</url><url>internal-pdf://Batista - 2020 - Estimation of the final size of the coronavirus epidemic by the logistic model(2).pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>In the note, the logistic growth regression model is used for the estimation of the final size and its peak time of the coronavirus epidemic. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No founding was received for this paper. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

The evidence that mandatory school closures reduce cases and ultimately mortality mostly comes from experience with influenza or from models that do not include the impact of school closure on the healthcare labor supply or the role of the healthcare labor force in reducing the per infection mortality from the pathogen. There is considerable uncertainty of the incremental effect of school closures on transmission and lives saved from school closures. The likely, but uncertain, benefits from school closure need to be weighed against uncertain, and seldom quantified, costs of healthcare worker absenteeism associated with additional child care obligations. Methods We analyze data from the US Current Population Survey to measure the potential child care obligations for US healthcare workers that will need to be addressed if school closures are employed as a social distancing measure. We account for the occupation within the healthcare sector, state, and household structure to identify the segments of the healthcare labor force that are most exposed to child care obligations from school closures. We use these estimates to identify the critical level for the importance of healthcare labor supply in increasing a patient's COVID-19 survival probability that would undo the benefits of school closures and ultimately increase cumulative mortality. Findings The US healthcare sector has some of the highest child care obligations in the United States. 29% of healthcare provider households must provide care for children 3-12. Assuming non-working adults or a sibling 13 years old or older can provide child care, leaves 15% of healthcare provider households in need of childcare during a school closure, while 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households. We document the substantial variation within the healthcare system. For example, 35% of medical assistants and 31% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aide households have child care obligations, while only 24% of emergency medical personnel have childcare obligations. Child care obligations can vary between states by over 10 percentage points. A 15% decline in the healthcare labor force, combined with reasonable parameters for COVID-19 such as a 15% case reduction from school closings and 2% baseline mortality rate implies that a 15% loss in the healthcare labor force must decrease the survival probability per percent healthcare worker lost by 17.6% for a school closure to increase cumulative mortality. This means that the per infection mortality rate cannot increase from 2% to 2.35% when the healthcare workforce declines by 15%; otherwise, school closures will lead to a greater number of deaths than they prevent. For school closures to unambiguously provide a net reduction in COVID-19 mortality with these parameters, the school closures must reduce cases by over 25%. Conclusion School closures come with many tradeoffs. Setting aside economic costs, school closures implemented to reduce COVID-19 spread create unintended childcare obligations, which are particularly large in healthcare occupations. Detailed data are provided to help public health officials make informed decisions about the tradeoffs associated with closing schools. The results suggest that it is unclear if the potential contagion prevention from school closures justifies the potential loss of healthcare workers from the standpoint of reducing cummulative mortality. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement no external funding ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Due to the lack of effective treatment options for 2019-nCoV, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of 2019-nCoV. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing a inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the 2019-nCoV 3C-like proteinase, followed by efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of 2019-nCoV with an inhibitory potency with Kd &amp;lt; 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra, could be used for the treatment of 2019-nCoV, although there is no real-world evidence supporting the prediction. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Behbahani, Mandana</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In silico Design of novel Multi-epitope recombinant Vaccine based on Coronavirus surface glycoprotein</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.10.985499</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.10.985499</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Behbahani - 2020 - In silico Design of novel Multi-epitope recombinant Vaccine based on Coronavirus surface glycoprotein.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>It is of special significance to find a safe and effective vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can induce T cell and B cell -mediated immune responses. There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. In this project, a novel multi-epitope vaccine for COVID-19 virus based on surface glycoprotein was designed through application of bioinformatics methods. At the first, seventeen potent linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from surface glycoprotein were predicted in silico, then the epitopes were joined together via different linkers. The ability of the selected epitopes to induce interferon-gamma was evaluate using IFNepitope web server. One final vaccine was constructed which composed of 398 amino acids and attached to 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 as adjuvant. Physicochemical properties, as well as antigenicity in the proposed vaccines, were checked for defining the vaccine stability and its ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses. Three-dimensional structure of the mentioned vaccine was subjected to the molecular docking studies with MHC-I and MHC-II molecules. The results proposed that the multi-epitope vaccine with 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 was a stable construct with high aliphatic content and high antigenicity.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Benvenuto, Domenico</author><author>Giovanetti, Marta</author><author>Salemi, Marco</author><author>Prosperi, Mattia</author><author>De Flora, Cecilia</author><author>Junior Alcantara, Luiz Carlos</author><author>Angeletti, Silvia</author><author>Ciccozzi, Massimo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The global spread of 2019-nCoV: a molecular evolutionary analysis</title><secondary-title>Pathogens and Global Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pathogens and Global Health</full-title></periodical><pages>1-4</pages><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>SARS</keyword><keyword>molecular Epidemiology</keyword><keyword>phylogeny</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/20477724.2020.1725339</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20477724.2020.1725339</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>ABSTRACTThe global spread of the 2019-nCoV is continuing and is fast moving, as indicated by the WHO raising the risk assessment to high.

In this article, we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular epidemiological analysis of this new virus. A phylogenetic tree has been built using the 15 available whole genome sequence of 2019-nCoV and 12 whole genome sequences highly similar sequences available in gene bank (5 from SARS, 2 from MERS and 5 from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus). FUBAR analysis shows that the Nucleocapsid and the Spike Glycoprotein has some sites under positive pressure while homology modelling helped to explain some molecular and structural differences between the viruses. The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019.nCoV significantly clustered with Bat SARS-like Coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in S and nucleocapsid proteins. From these results, 2019nCoV could be considered a coronavirus distinct from SARS virus, probably transmitted from bats or another host where mutations conferred upon it the ability to infect humans.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bernard Stoecklin, Sibylle</author><author>Rolland, Patrick</author><author>Silue, Yassoungo</author><author>Mailles, Alexandra</author><author>Campese, Christine</author><author>Simondon, Anne</author><author>Mechain, Matthieu</author><author>Meurice, Laure</author><author>Nguyen, Mathieu</author><author>Bassi, Clément</author><author>Yamani, Estelle</author><author>Behillil, Sylvie</author><author>Ismael, Sophie</author><author>Nguyen, Duc</author><author>Malvy, Denis</author><author>Lescure, François Xavier</author><author>Georges, Scarlett</author><author>Lazarus, Clément</author><author>Tabaï, Anouk</author><author>Stempfelet, Morgane</author><author>Enouf, Vincent</author><author>Coignard, Bruno</author><author>Levy-Bruhl, Daniel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>First cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in France: surveillance, investigations and control measures, January 2020</title><secondary-title>Eurosurveillance</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Eurosurveillance</full-title></periodical><volume>25</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Euro Surveill</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.6.2000094</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.6.2000094</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bernheim, Adam</author><author>Mei, Xueyan</author><author>Huang, Mingqian</author><author>Yang, Yang</author><author>Fayad, Zahi A.</author><author>Zhang, Ning</author><author>Diao, Kaiyue</author><author>Lin, Bin</author><author>Zhu, Xiqi</author><author>Li, Kunwei</author><author>Li, Shaolin</author><author>Shan, Hong</author><author>Jacobi, Adam</author><author>Chung, Michael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chest CT Findings in Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19): Relationship to Duration of Infection</title><secondary-title>Radiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Radiology</full-title></periodical><pages>200463</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher> Radiological Society of North America </publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1148/radiol.2020200463</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2020200463</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Abstract In this retrospective study, chest CTs of 121 symptomatic patients infected with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) from four centers in China from January 18, 2020 to February 2, 2020 were...</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Berra, Lorenzo</author><author>Lei, Chong</author><author>Su, Binxiao</author><author>Dong, Hailong</author><author>Fakhr, Bijan Safaee</author><author>Grassi, Luigi Giuseppe</author><author>Fenza, Raffaele Di</author><author>Gianni, Stefano</author><author>Pinciroli, Riccardo</author><author>Vassena, Emanuele</author><author>Morais, Caio Cesar Araujo</author><author>Bellavia, Andrea</author><author>Spina, Stefano</author><author>Kacmarek, Robert</author><author>Carroll, Ryan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Protocol for a randomized controlled trial testing inhaled nitric oxide therapy in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.10.20033522</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.10.20033522</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Introduction: the current worldwide outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is seriously threatening the public health. The number of infected patients is continuously increasing and the need for Intensive Care Unit admission ranges from 5 to 26%. The mortality is reported to be around 3.4% with higher values for the elderly and in patients with comorbidities. Moreover, this condition is challenging the healthcare system where the outbreak reached its highest value. To date there is still no available treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) has a beneficial effect on the coronavirus-mediated acute respiratory syndrome, and this can be related to its viricidal effect. The time from the symptoms onset to the development of severe respiratory distress is relatively long. We hypothesize that high concentrations of inhaled NO administered during early phases of COVID-19 infection can prevent the progression of the disease. Methods and analysis: This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Spontaneous breathing patients admitted to the hospital for symptomatic COVID-19 infection will be eligible to enter the study. Patients in the treatment group will receive inhaled NO at high doses (140-180 parts per million) for 30 minutes, 2 sessions every day for 14 days in addition to the hospital care. Patient in the control group will receive only hospital care. The primary outcome is the percentage of patients requiring endotracheal intubation due to the progression of the disease in the first 28 days from enrollment in the study. Secondary outcomes include mortality at 28 days, proportion of negative test for SARS-CoV-2 at 7 days and time to clinical recovery. Ethics and dissemination: The trial protocol has been approved at the Investigation Review Boards of Xijing Hospital (Xi an, China) and The Partners Human Research Committee of Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA) is pending. Recruitment is expected to start in March 2020. Results of this study will be published in scientific journals, presented at scientific meetings, and on related website or media in fighting this widespread contagious disease. Trial registration.

Healthcare authorities already initiated awareness and preparedness activities beyond the borders. A poor understanding of the disease among healthcare workers (HCWs) may implicate in delayed treatment and the rapid spread of infection. The study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. Chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance level of p&lt;0.05. Results: Of 529 participated, a total of 453 HCWs complete the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% are males, aged 25-34 years (32.1%), and most of them are doctors (30.2%) and medical students (29.6%). Regarding COVID-19, most of them used social media to obtain the information (61%), a significant proportion of HCWs had poor knowledge of its transmission (61%), and symptoms onset (63.6%) and showed a positive perception of COVID-19 prevention and control. Factors such as age and profession are associated with inadequate knowledge and poor perception of COVID-19. Conclusion: As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improving knowledge and perceptions among HCWs. Educational interventions are urgently needed to reach HCWs beyond the borders, and further studies are warranted.

The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control. Methods The Shenzhen CDC identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases from January 14 to February 12, 2020 and 1286 close contacts. We compare cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimate the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and hospitalization. We estimate metrics of disease transmission and analyze factors influencing transmission risk. Findings Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45) and balanced between males (187) and females (204). Ninety-one percent had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. Three have died, 225 have recovered (median time to recovery is 32 days). Cases were isolated on average 4.6 days after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1.9 days. Household contacts and those travelling with a case where at higher risk of infection (ORs 6 and 7) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 15%, and children were as likely to be infected as adults. The observed reproductive number was 0.4, with a mean serial interval of 6.3 days. Interpretation Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. This work shows that heightened surveillance and isolation, particularly contact tracing, reduces the time cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing R. Its overall impact, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. We further show that children are at similar risk of infection as the general population, though less likely to have severe symptoms; hence should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

While person-to-person transmission within the Wuhan district has led to a large outbreak, the transmission potential outside of the region remains unclear. Here we present a simple approach for determining whether the upper limit of the confidence interval for the reproduction number exceeds one for transmission in the United States, which would allow endemic transmission. As of February 7, 2020, the number of cases in the United states support subcritical transmission, rather than ongoing transmission. However, this conclusion can change if pre-symptomatic cases resulting from human-to-human transmission have not yet been identified.

Our model contains only one fitting parameter, which we determine from the data supplied by the world health organisation for the total number of cases and new cases each day. We find that our model provides a surprisingly good fit to the currently-available data. It predicts that the disease will run its full course over six to seven months, starting from the date on which the world health organisation provided the first `Situation report' (21 January 2020 $-$ day 1). The disease may be expected to infect approximately $25\%$ of the global population, i.e. about $1.95$ billion people, taking approximately $85$ million lives. Unless drastic new interventions become possible, the global number of new cases is predicted to peak on day 126 (about the middle of May 2020), with an estimated $75$ million new cases per day. Since our simple model fits the available global data so well, we suggests that the measures being taken so far to contain the pandemic may be ineffective in curbing the global spread of the virus. As such, the efficacy of the measures that are currently being taken to contain the coronavirus should be carefully weighed against their impact on the world economy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brandenburg, Axel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quadratic growth during the 2019 novel coronavirus epidemic</title><secondary-title>arXiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>arXiv</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03638</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The number of infections and the number of fatalities in the 2019 novel coronavirus epidemics follows a remarkably regular trend.

The increase appears to be roughly exponential, but with an e-folding time that gradually increases from just two days at the end of January to about ten days by February 9. Here we show that, since January 20, the number of fatalities and infections increases quadratically and not exponentially, as widely believed. At present, no departure from this behavior can be seen, allowing tentative predictions to be made for the next 1-2 months.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brielle, Esther S</author><author>Schneidman, Dina</author><author>Linial, Michal</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The SARS-CoV-2 exerts a distinctive strategy for interacting with the ACE2 human receptor</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.10.986398</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.10.986398</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The COVID-19 disease has plagued over 110 countries and has resulted in over 4,000 deaths within 10 weeks. We compare the interaction between the human ACE2 receptor and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with that of other pathogenic coronaviruses using molecular dynamics simulations. SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-NL63 recognize ACE2 as the natural receptor but present a distinct binding interface to ACE2 and a different network of residue-residue contacts. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have comparable binding affinities achieved by balancing energetics and dynamics. The SARS-CoV-2 - ACE2 complex contains a higher number of contacts, a larger interface area, and decreased interface residue fluctuations relative to SARS-CoV. These findings expose an exceptional evolutionary exploration exerted by coronaviruses toward host recognition. We postulate that the versatility of cell receptor binding strategies has immediate implications on therapeutic strategies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brooks, Samantha K</author><author>Webster, Rebecca K</author><author>Smith, Louise E</author><author>Woodland, Lisa</author><author>Wessely, Simon</author><author>Greenberg, Neil</author><author>Rubin, Gideon James</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: rapid review of the evidence</title><secondary-title>The Lancet</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Lancet</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673620304608</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brooks, Samantha K</author><author>Webster, Rebecca K</author><author>Smith, Louise E</author><author>Woodland, Lisa</author><author>Wessely, Simon</author><author>Neil Greenberg, FMedSci</author><author>James Rubin, FRCPsych G</author><author>Wessely FMedSci, Simon</author><author>Greenberg FRCPsych, Neil</author><author>James Rubin, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: Rapid review of the evidence</title><secondary-title>The Lancet</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Infectious diseases</keyword><keyword>Isolation</keyword><keyword>Mental health</keyword><keyword>Psychological well being</keyword><keyword>Quarantine</keyword><keyword>Wuhan</keyword><keyword>nCov</keyword></keywords><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ssrn.com/abstract=3532534</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The January 2020 coronavirus outbreak has seen many countries plan to 'self-isolate' or quarantine people who have potentially come into contact with the infection. Decisions on how to apply quarantine should be based on best available evidence. We conducted a rapid review of the psychological impact of quarantine using three electronic databases. 3166 papers were found and 24 included in the review. The majority of reviewed studies reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss and stigma. Some suggested long-lasting effects. Where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine for no longer than necessary; provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols; and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be beneficial.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Broughton, James P</author><author>Deng, Xianding</author><author>Yu, Guixia</author><author>Fasching, Clare L</author><author>Singh, Jasmeet</author><author>Streithorst, Jessica</author><author>Granados, Andrea</author><author>Sotomayor-Gonzalez, Alicia</author><author>Zorn, Kelsey</author><author>Gopez, Allan</author><author>Hsu, Elaine</author><author>Gu, Wei</author><author>Miller, Steven</author><author>Pan, Chao-Yang</author><author>Guevara, Hugo</author><author>Wadford, Debra</author><author>Chen, Janice</author><author>Chiu, Charles Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rapid Detection of 2019 Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Using a CRISPR-based DETECTR Lateral Flow Assay</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.06.20032334</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.06.20032334</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>An outbreak of novel betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (formerly named 2019-nCoV), began in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and the COVID-19 disease associated with infection has since spread rapidly to multiple countries. Here we report the development of SARS-CoV-2 DETECTR, a rapid (~30 min), low-cost, and accurate CRISPR-Cas12 based lateral flow assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2. We validated this method using contrived reference samples and clinical samples from infected US patients and demonstrated comparable performance to the US CDC SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR assay.

Methods: The meteorological factors during the outbreak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan in 2019 were collected and analyzed, and were confirmed with those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003. Data of patients infected with 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus were collected from WHO website and other public sources. Results: This study found that the suitable temperature range for 2019-nCoV coronavirus survival is (13-24 degree Celsius), among which 19 degree Celsius lasting about 60 days is conducive to the spread between the vector and humans; the humidity range is 50%-80%, of which about 75% humidity is conducive to the survival of the coronavirus; the suitable precipitation range is below 30 mm/ month. Cold air and continuous low temperature over one week are helpful for the elimination of the virus. The prediction results show that with the approach of spring, the temperature in north China gradually rises, and the coronavirus spreads to middle and high latitudes along the temperature line of 13-18 degree Celsius. The population of new coronavirus infections is concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai and other urban agglomerations. Starting from May 2020, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, the Central China Zhengzhou-Wuhan urban agglomeration, the eastern Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai urban agglomeration, and the southern Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration are all under a high temperature above 24 degree Celsius, which is not conducive to the survival and reproduction of coronaviruses, so the epidemic is expected to end. Conclusions: A wide range of continuous warm and dry weather is conducive to the survival of 2019-nCoV. The coming of spring, in addition to the original Wuhan-Zhengzhou urban agglomeration in central China, means that the prevention and control measures in big cities located in mid-latitude should be strengthened, especially the monitoring of transportation hubs. The Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration is a concentrated area of population in south China, with a faster temperature rise than those in mid-high latitudes, and thus the prevention in this area should be prioritized. From a global perspective, cities with a mean temperature below 24 degree Celsius are all high-risk cities for 2019-nCoV transmission before June.

In the absence of an effective vaccine, inhibitor repurposing or de novo design may offer a longer-term strategy to combat this and future infections due to similar viruses. Here, we report on detailed molecular dynamics simulations of the main protease (Mpro). We compared and contrasted the Mpro for COVID-19 with a highly similar SARS protein. In spite of a high level of sequence similarity, the active sites in both proteins show major differences in both shape and size indicating that repurposing SARS drugs for COVID-19 may be futile. Furthermore, analysis of the pocket's time-dependence indicates its flexibility and plasticity, which dashes hopes for rapid and reliable drug design. Conversely, structural stability of the protein with respect to flexible loop mutations indicates that the virus' mutability will pose a further challenge to the rational design of small-molecule inhibitors.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Caccavo, Diego</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chinese and Italian COVID-19 outbreaks can be correctly described by a modified SIRD model</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.19.20039388</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.19.20039388</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The COVID-19 disease is rapidly spreading in whole globe, affecting millions of people and pushing governments to take drastic measures to contain the outbreaks. The understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic is of great interest for the governments and health authorities that are facing COVID-19 outbreaks. The scarce presence of epidemiologic data, due to the still ongoing outbreaks, makes prediction difficult and mainly based on heuristic (fitting) models. However, these models with non-physical based parameters, can only give limited insight in the evolution of the outbreaks. In this work a SIRD compartmental model was developed to describe and predict the evolution of the Chinese and Italian outbreaks. Exploiting the similarities of the measures taken by the governments to contain the virus and of the total population number of Hubei province and Italy, the model was tuned on the Chinese outbreak (almost extinguished) and by perturbation the Italian outbreak was describe and predicted. With this approach the lack of data due to the still ongoing Italian epidemic was compensated by the Chinese experience, allowing to obtain a SIRD model for this relatively new COVID-19 outbreak. According to the modeling prediction the peak of infection should be on the 28th of March, with almost 42,000 infected people.

Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed four large-scale datasets of normal lung tissue to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression. No significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression were found between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (&gt;60 vs &lt;60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in smoker samples compared to non-smoker samples. This indicates the smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and thus smoking history should be considered in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.

Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed four large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (&gt;60 vs &lt;60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.

Previous investigations reported patients in Wuhan city often progressed into severe or critical and had a high mortality rate.The clinical characteristics of affected patients outside the epicenter of Hubei province are less well understood. Methods All confirmed COVID-19 case treated in the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen,from January 11, 2020 to February 6, 2020, were included in this study. We analyzed the epidemiological and clinical features of these cases to better inform patient management in normal hospital settings. Results Among the 298 confirmed cases, 233(81.5%) had been to Hubei while 42(14%) had not clear epidemiological history. Only 192(64%) cases presented with fever as initial symptom. The lymphocyte count decreased in 38% patients after admission. The number (percent) of cases classified as non-severe and severe was 240(80.6%) and 58(19.4%) respectively. Thirty-two patients (10.7%) needed ICU care. Compared to the non-severe cases, severe cases were associated with older age, underlying diseases, as well as higher levels of CRP, IL-6 and ESR. The median (IRQ) duration of positive viral test were 14(10-19). Slower clearance of virus was associated with higher risk of progression to severe clinical condition. As of February 14, 2020, 66(22.1%) patients were discharged and the overall mortality rate remains 0. Conclusions In a designated hospital outside the Hubei Province, COVID-19 patients were mainly characterized by mild symptoms and could be effectively manage by properly using the existing hospital system.

The illness was caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical manifestations related to SARS-CoV-2 infection ranged from no symptom to fatal pneumonia. World Health Organization (WHO) named the diseases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection as COVID-19. Real time RT-PCR is the only laboratory test available till now to confirm the infection. However, the accuracy of real time RT-PCR depends on many factors, including sampling location and of methods, quality of RNA extraction and training of operators etc. Variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of the detection. We developed a peptide-based luminescent immunoassay to detect IgG and IgM. Cut-off value of this assay was determined by the detection of 200 healthy sera and 167 sera from patients infected with other pathogens than SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the performance of this assay, we detected IgG and IgM in the 276 sera from confirmed patients. The positive rate of IgG and IgM were 71.4% (197/276) and 57.2% (158/276) respectively. By combining with real time RT-PCR detection, this assay might help to enhance the accuracy of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The difference in the mortality of confirmed and severe cases before and after the use of Fangcang, Huoshenshan, and Leishenshan makeshift hospitals (MSHs) was tested using Mann-Whitney U test. We also studied whether air temperature (AT) could affect the above outcomes of COVID-19 cases by performing Spearman analysis. Results The mortality of confirmed cases was significantly decreased both in Wuhan (U = 1, P &lt; 0.001) and Hubei (U = 0, P &lt; 0.001), while in non-Hubei regions, as a contrast, the mortality of confirmed cases remained unchanged (U = 40, P = 0.139). However, another eight days later, changes in the mortality in non-Hubei regions also became significant (U = 73, P = 0.039). Mortality of confirmed cases was found to be significantly correlated with temperature both in Wuhan (r = -0.441, P = 0.012) and Hubei (r = -0.440, P = 0.012). Conclusions Our findings indicated that both the use of MSHs and the rise of AT were beneficial to the survival of COVID-19 cases.

The case fatality rate is the most direct indicator to assess the hazards of an infectious disease. We aimed to estimate the instant fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and its affiliated Hubei Province. Methods We collected the daily case notification data of COVID-19 from Dec 8, 2019 to Mar 10, 2020 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province officially announced by the Chinese authority. The numbers of daily confirmed/deaths/cured cases and the numbers of daily cumulative confirmed/deaths/cured cases were obtained. The death time and cure time of COVID-19 patients were calculated based on the dates of diagnosis, death and discharge of individual cases. Then the estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were obtained on the basis of the median death or medium cure time, respectively. Finally, the instant fatality rate of COVID-19 was calculated according to the numbers of deaths and cured cases on the same estimated diagnosis dates. Results From Jan 1, 2020 to Feb 22, 2020 in Wuhan City, the instant case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 3.4%～19.5% and the instant cured rate was 80.0%～96.6%. The average fatality rate reached 11.4% while the average cure rate was 88.6%. During the same period in Hubei Province, the instant case fatality rate was 3.8%～16.6% and the instant cured rate was 83.4%～96.6%. The average fatality rate and the average cure rate were 9.2% and 91.8%, respectively. Conclusions The fatality rate and cure rate of COVID-19 in Wuhan City and Hubei Province were underestimated. Wuhan showed higher fatality rate and cure rate than the whole Hubei Province did.

Here we identify the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients in Shanghai. Methods: Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological features. Results: Of 198 patients, the median duration from disease onset to hospital admission was 4 days. The mean age of the patients was 50.1 years, and 51.0% patients were male. The most common symptom was fever. Less than half of the patients presented with respiratory systems including cough, sputum production, itchy or sore throat, shortness of breath, and chest congestion. 5.6% patients had diarrhoea. On admission, T lymphocytes were decreased in 45.8% patients. Ground glass opacity was the most common radiological finding on chest computed tomography. 9.6% were admitted to the ICU because of the development of organ dysfunction. Compared with patients not treated in ICU, patients treated in the ICU were older, had longer waiting time to admission, fever over 38.5o C, dyspnoea, reduced T lymphocytes, elevated neutrophils and organ failure. Conclusions: In this single centre cohort of COVID-19 patients, the most common symptom was fever, and the most common laboratory abnormality was decreased blood T cell counts. Older age, male, fever over 38.5oC, symptoms of dyspnoea, and underlying comorbidity, were the risk factors most associated with severity of disease. Key words: 2019 novel coronavirus; acute respiratory infection; risk factors for disease severity

Methods: We performed a retrospective study on the clinical characteristics of 128 COVID-19 cases with laboratory-confirmed from Xiangyang No 1 Hospitalad during January 2020 to 16 February 2020. Results: Female patients account for 53.1%. The aged below 20 years that accounts for 1.6% of overall patients. The aged in 21~50, 51~65, over 66 years were accounts for 44.5%, 35.1%,18.8%, respectively. In the difference age spectrum, all severe groups compared with non-severe groups were difference significantly ( P &lt; 0.01 ). Fever ( 89.8% ) and Cough ( 67.2% ) were common clinical symptoms. The rate of patients with sore throats (14.1%) was rare. The rate of chest computed tomography scan showing ground glass opacity in overall, non-severe, severe groups were 63.3%, 60.7%, 76.2%, respectively. White blood cell counts in the normal range of overall patients, but severe group patients were increased significantly ( P &lt; 0.01). Lymphocytes of overall patients were decreased. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) in the normal range of overall patients, but its were elevated in the severe group. Creatinine (CR) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of overall patients in the normal range. C-reactive protein (CRP) level of all patients were increased markedly, but it in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the non-severe group ( P &lt; 0.01 ). Conclusions: Our data provide more information that advanced age, lower lymphocytes levels at the diagnosed COVID-19 patients may be a risk factor for unfavourable prognosis. The white blood cells and C-reactive protein level elevated in severe COVID-19 patients may be accompanying bacterial infection. 2019-nCov may be carries a risk factor of impaired liver and kidney function.

As a result, the current literature reports widely varying estimates. We developed an alternative geo-stratified debiasing estimation framework by incorporating human mobility with case reporting data in three stratified zones, i.e., Wuhan, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, and mainland China excluding Hubei. We estimated the latent infection ratio to be around 0.12% (18,556 people) and the basic reproduction number to be 3.24 in Wuhan before the city&amp;#039;s lockdown on January 23, 2020. The findings based on this debiasing framework have important implications to prioritization of control and prevention efforts.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported in part by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology (2016QY02D0305), National Natural Science Foundation of China (71621002, 71771213, 71790615, 71972164 and 91846301), Chinese Academy of Sciences (ZDRW-XH-2017-3), and the Hunan Science and Technology Plan Project (2017RS3040, 2018JJ1034).

Rapidly the new coronavirus has spread worldwide. China CDC has reported results of a descriptive exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed until the 11th February 2020, presenting the epidemiologic curves and geo-temporal spread of COVID-19 along with case fatality rate according to some baseline characteristics, such as age, gender and several well-established high prevalence comorbidities. Despite this, we intend to increase even further the predictive value of that manuscript by presenting the odds ratio for mortality due to COVID-19 adjusted for the presence of those comorbidities and baseline characteristics such as age and gender. Besides, we present a way to determine the risk of each particular patient, given his characteristics. We found that age is the variable that presents higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, where 60 or older patients have an OR = 18.8161 (CI95%[7.1997; 41.5517]). Regarding comorbidities, cardiovascular disease appears to be the riskiest (OR=12.8328 CI95%[10.2736; 15.8643], along with chronic respiratory disease (OR=7.7925 CI95%[5.5446; 10.4319]). Males are more likely to die from COVID-19 (OR=1.8518 (CI95%[1.5996; 2.1270]). Some limitations such as the lack of information about the correct prevalence of gender per age or about comorbidities per age and gender or the assumption of independence between risk factors are expected to have a small impact on results. A final point of paramount importance is that the equation presented here can be used to determine the probability of dying from COVID-19 for a particular patient, given its age interval, gender and comorbidities associated.

The proposed data analysis permits an evaluation of the maximum number of infected individuals. The daily data must be compared with the obtained fits to verify if the spreading is under control. From our analysis it appears that the spreading is reaching saturation in China and Singapore, due to the strong containment policy of the national governments. For South Korea and Italy, instead, the data of the first week of March on the new infections, will be crucial to understand if the saturation will be reached for lower or higher numbers of infected individuals. This will show whether a strong containment policy is worth keeping.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ceraolo, Carmine</author><author>Giorgi, Federico M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genomic variance of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.02.931162</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.02.931162</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/05/2020.02.02.931162.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>There is rising global concern for the recently emerged novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov). Full genomic sequences have been released by the worldwide scientific community in the last few weeks in order to understand the evolutionary origin and molecular characteristics of this virus. Taking advantage of all the genomic information currently available, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including also representatives of other coronaviridae, such as Bat coronavirus (BCoV) and SARS. We confirm high sequence similarity (&amp;gt;99%) between all sequenced 2019-nCoVs genomes available, with the closest BCoV sequence sharing 96.2% sequence identity, confirming the notion of a zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV. Despite the low heterogeneity of the 2019-nCoV genomes, we could identify at least two hyper-variable genomic hotspots, one of which is responsible for a Serine/Leucine variation in the viral ORF8-encoded protein. Finally, we perform a full proteomic comparison with other coronaviridae, identifying key aminoacidic differences to be considered for antiviral strategies deriving from previous anti-coronavirus approaches.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cereda, D</author><author>Tirani, M</author><author>Rovida, T</author><author>Demicheli, V</author><author>Ajelli, M</author><author>Poletti, P</author><author>Trentini, R</author><author>Guzzetta, G</author><author>Marziano, V</author><author>Barone, A</author><author>Magoni, M</author><author>Deandrea, S</author><author>Diurno, G</author><author>Lombardo, M</author><author>Faccini, M</author><author>Pan, A</author><author>Bruno, R</author><author>Pariani, E</author><author>Grasselli, G</author><author>Piatti, A</author><author>Gramegna, M</author><author>Baldanti, F</author><author>Melegaro, A</author><author>Merler, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09320</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>In the night of February 20, 2020, the first case of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was confirmed in the Lombardy Region, Italy. In the week that followed, Lombardy experienced a very rapid increase in the number of cases. We analyzed the first 5,830 laboratory-confirmed cases to provide the first epidemiological characterization of a COVID-19 outbreak in a Western Country. Epidemiological data were collected through standardized interviews of confirmed cases and their close contacts. We collected demographic backgrounds, dates of symptom onset, clinical features, respiratory tract specimen results, hospitalization, contact tracing. We provide estimates of the reproduction number and serial interval. The epidemic in Italy started much earlier than February 20, 2020. At the time of detection of the first COVID-19 case, the epidemic had already spread in most municipalities of Southern-Lombardy. The median age for of cases is 69 years (range, 1 month to 101 years). 47% of positive subjects were hospitalized. Among these, 18% required intensive care. The mean serial interval is estimated to be 6.6 days (95% CI, 0.7 to 19). We estimate the basic reproduction number at 3.1 (95% CI, 2.9 to 3.2). We estimated a decreasing trend in the net reproduction number starting around February 20, 2020. We did not observe significantly different viral loads in nasal swabs between symptomatic and asymptomatic. The transmission potential of COVID-19 is very high and the number of critical cases may become largely unsustainable for the healthcare system in a very short-time horizon. We observed a slight decrease of the reproduction number, possibly connected with an increased population awareness and early effect of interventions. Aggressive containment strategies are required to control COVID-19 spread and catastrophic outcomes for the healthcare system.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chai, Xiaoqiang</author><author>Hu, Longfei</author><author>Zhang, Yan</author><author>Han, Weiyu</author><author>Lu, Zhou</author><author>Ke, Aiwu</author><author>Zhou, Jian</author><author>Shi, Guoming</author><author>Fang, Nan</author><author>Fan, Jia</author><author>Cai, Jiabin</author><author>Fan, Jue</author><author>Lan, Fei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Specific ACE2 Expression in Cholangiocytes May Cause Liver Damage After 2019-nCoV Infection</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.03.931766</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.03.931766</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/04/2020.02.03.931766.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>A newly identified coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has been posing significant threats to public health since December 2019. ACE2, the host cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), has recently been demonstrated in mediating 2019-nCoV infection. Interestingly, besides the respiratory system, substantial proportion of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients showed signs of various degrees of liver damage, the mechanism and implication of which have not yet been determined. Here, we performed an unbiased evaluation of cell type specific expression of ACE2 in healthy liver tissues using single cell RNA-seq data of two independent cohorts, and identified specific expression in cholangiocytes. The results indicated that virus might directly bind to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes but not necessarily hepatocytes. This finding suggested the liver abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may not be due to hepatocyte damage, but cholangiocyte dysfunction and other causes such as drug induced and systemic inflammatory response induced liver injury. Our findings indicate that special care of liver dysfunction should be installed in treating 2019-nCoV patients during the hospitalization and shortly after cure.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo</author><author>Kok, Kin-Hang</author><author>Zhu, Zheng</author><author>Chu, Hin</author><author>To, Kelvin Kai-Wang</author><author>Yuan, Shuofeng</author><author>Yuen, Kwok-Yung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genomic characterization of the 2019 novel human-pathogenic coronavirus isolated from a patient with atypical pneumonia after visiting Wuhan</title><secondary-title>Emerging microbes &amp; infections</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Emerging microbes &amp; infections</full-title></periodical><pages>221-236</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>SARS</keyword><keyword>Wuhan</keyword><keyword>bioinformatics</keyword><keyword>emerging</keyword><keyword>genome</keyword><keyword>respiratory</keyword><keyword>virus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><accession-num>31987001</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/22221751.2020.1719902</electronic-resource-num><notes>31987001[pmid]</notes><research-notes>31987001[pmid]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31987001</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>A mysterious outbreak of atypical pneumonia in late 2019 was traced to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan of China. Within a few weeks, a novel coronavirus tentatively named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was announced by the World Health Organization. We performed bioinformatics analysis on a virus genome from a patient with 2019-nCoV infection and compared it with other related coronavirus genomes. Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses. However, the external subdomain of Spike's receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. Remarkably, its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands. Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus would be important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus. These findings provide the basis for starting further studies on the pathogenesis, and optimizing the design of diagnostic, antiviral and vaccination strategies for this emerging infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo</author><author>Yuan, Shuofeng</author><author>Kok, Kin-Hang</author><author>To, Kelvin Kai-Wang</author><author>Chu, Hin</author><author>Yang, Jin</author><author>Xing, Fanfan</author><author>Liu, Jieling</author><author>Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan</author><author>Poon, Rosana Wing-Shan</author><author>Tsoi, Hoi-Wah</author><author>Lo, Simon Kam-Fai</author><author>Chan, Kwok-Hung</author><author>Poon, Vincent Kwok-Man</author><author>Chan, Wan-Mui</author><author>Ip, Jonathan Daniel</author><author>Cai, Jian-Piao</author><author>Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung</author><author>Chen, Honglin</author><author>Hui, Christopher Kim-Ming</author><author>Yuen, Kwok-Yung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A familial cluster of pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus indicating person-to-person transmission: a study of a family cluster</title><secondary-title>Lancet (London, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lancet (London, England)</full-title></periodical><pages>S0140-6736(20)30154-9</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><accession-num>31986261</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30154-9</electronic-resource-num><notes>31986261[pmid] S0140-6736(20)30154-9[PII]</notes><research-notes>31986261[pmid] S0140-6736(20)30154-9[PII]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31986261</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>BACKGROUND: An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Affected patients were geographically linked with a local wet market as a potential source. No data on person-to-person or nosocomial transmission have been published to date. METHODS: In this study, we report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and microbiological findings of five patients in a family cluster who presented with unexplained pneumonia after returning to Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China, after a visit to Wuhan, and an additional family member who did not travel to Wuhan. Phylogenetic analysis of genetic sequences from these patients were done. FINDINGS: From Jan 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of six patients who travelled to Wuhan from Shenzhen between Dec 29, 2019 and Jan 4, 2020. Of six family members who travelled to Wuhan, five were identified as infected with the novel coronavirus. Additionally, one family member, who did not travel to Wuhan, became infected with the virus after several days of contact with four of the family members. None of the family members had contacts with Wuhan markets or animals, although two had visited a Wuhan hospital. Five family members (aged 36-66 years) presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, or diarrhoea, or a combination of these 3-6 days after exposure. They presented to our hospital (The University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen) 6-10 days after symptom onset. They and one asymptomatic child (aged 10 years) had radiological ground-glass lung opacities. Older patients (aged &gt;60 years) had more systemic symptoms, extensive radiological ground-glass lung changes, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased C-reactive protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these six patients were negative for known respiratory microbes by point-of-care multiplex RT-PCR, but five patients (four adults and the child) were RT-PCR positive for genes encoding the internal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and surface Spike protein of this novel coronavirus, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of these five patients' RT-PCR amplicons and two full genomes by next-generation sequencing showed that this is a novel coronavirus, which is closest to the bat severe acute respiatory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats. INTERPRETATION: Our findings are consistent with person-to-person transmission of this novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings, and the reports of infected travellers in other geographical regions.

Common presentations of confirmed cases include fever, fatigue, dry cough, upper airway congestion, sputum production, shortness of breath, myalgia/arthralgia with lymphopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. The reported severe/critical case ratio is approximately 7–10% and median time to intensive care admission is 9.5–10.5 days with mortality of around 1–2% varied geographically. Similar to outbreaks of other newly identified virus, there is no proven regimen from conventional medicine and most reports managed the patients with lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, beta-interferon, glucocorticoid and supportive treatment with remdesivir undergoing clinical trial. In China, Chinese medicine is proposed as a treatment option by national and provincial guidelines with substantial utilization. We reviewed the latest national and provincial clinical guidelines, retrospective cohort studies, and case series regarding the treatment of COVID-19 by add-on Chinese medicine. We have also reviewed the clinical evidence generated from SARS and H1N1 management with hypothesized mechanisms and latest in silico findings to identify candidate Chinese medicines for the consideration of possible trials and management. Given the paucity of strongly evidence-based regimens, the available data suggest that Chinese medicine could be considered as an adjunctive therapeutic option in the management of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chang, De</author><author>Lin, Minggui</author><author>Wei, Lai</author><author>Xie, Lixin</author><author>Zhu, Guangfa</author><author>Dela Cruz, Charles S</author><author>Sharma, Lokesh</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiologic and Clinical Characteristics of Novel Coronavirus Infections Involving 13 Patients Outside Wuhan, China</title><secondary-title>JAMA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA</full-title></periodical><pages>10.1001/jama.2020.1623</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>10.1001/jama.2020.1623</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031568</url><url>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2761043</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Biqing</author><author>Liang, Hao</author><author>Yuan, Xiaomin</author><author>Hu, Yingying</author><author>Xu, Miao</author><author>Zhao, Yating</author><author>Zhang, Binfen</author><author>Tian, Fang</author><author>Zhu, Xuejun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Roles of meteorological conditions in COVID-19 transmission on a worldwide scale</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.16.20037168</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.16.20037168</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/ 2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has caused great damage to public health and economy worldwide with over 140,000 infected cases up to date. Previous research has suggested an involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, such as influenza. However, as for the recent novel coronavirus, few studies have discussed systematically about the role of daily weather in the epidemic transmission of the virus. Here, we examine the relationships of meteorological variables with the severity of the outbreak on a worldwide scale. The confirmed case counts, which indicates the severity of COVID-19 spread, and four meteorological variables, i.e., air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and visibility, were collected daily between January 20 and March 11 (52 days) for 430 cities and districts all over China, 21 cities/ provinces in Italy, 21 cities/ provinces in Japan, and 51 other countries around the world. Four different time delays of weather (on the day, 3 days ago, 7 days ago, and 14 days ago) as to the epidemic situation were taken for modeling and we finally chose the weather two weeks ago to model against the daily epidemic situation as its correlated with the outbreak best. Taken Chinese cities as a discovery dataset, it was suggested that temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity combined together could best predict the epidemic situation. The meteorological model could well predict the outbreak around the world with a high correlation (r2&gt;0.6) with the real data. Using this model, we further predicted the possible epidemic situation in the future 12 days in several high-latitude cities with potential outbreak. This model could provide more information for government's future decisions on COVID-19 outbreak control.

SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and causes prevalent hypokalemia METHODS: The patients with COVID-19 were classified into severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, and normokalemia group. The study aimed to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and clinical features, the underlying causes and clinical implications of hypokalemia. RESULTS: By Feb 15, 2020, 175 patients with COVID-19 (92 women and 83 men; median age, 46 [IQR, 34-54] years) were admitted to hospital in Wenzhou, China, consisting 39 severe hypokalemia-, 69 hypokalemia-, and 67 normokalemia patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not associated with hypokalemia among 108 hypokalemia patients (P&gt;0.05). Body temperature, CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P&lt;0.01). 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia which was most common among elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP. Urine K+ loss was the primary cause of hypokalemia. severe hypokalemia patients was given 3 g/day, adding up to an average of 34 (SD=4) g potassium during hospital stay. The exciting finding was that patients responded well to K+ supplements when they were inclined to recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Hypokalemia is prevailing in patients with COVID-19. The correction of hypokalemia is challenging because of continuous renal K+ loss resulting from the degradation of ACE2. The end of urine K+ loss indicates a good prognosis and may be a reliable, in-time, and sensitive biomarker directly reflecting the end of adverse effect on RAS system. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This study was supported by Key scientific and technological innovation projects of Wenzhou (ZY202004) and Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo (2017A610273).

Many state-of-the-art researches  focus on predicting infection scale or threshold. Few researchers pay attention to the predicting of infection nodes from a snapshot. With developing of precision marketing,  recommending and, controlling, how to predict infection nodes precisely from snapshot becomes a key issue in spreading dynamics analysis.  In this paper, a probability based prediction model is presented so as to estimate the infection nodes from a snapshot of spreading.

This study aimed to compare the accuracy and precision of wrist and forehead temperature with tympanic temperature under different circumstances. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study in a real-life population. We consecutively collected wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius (C) using a non-contact infrared thermometer (NCIT). We also measured the tympanic temperature using a tympanic thermometers (IRTT) and defined fever as a tympanic temperature ≥37.3C. Results: We enrolled a total of 528 participants including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants. We divided outdoor participants into four types according to their means of transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle, electric vehicle, car, and inside the car. Under different circumstance, the mean difference ranged from -1.72 to -0.56C in different groups for the forehead measurements, and -0.96 to -0.61C for the wrist measurements. Both measurements had high fever screening abilities in inpatients (wrist: AUC 0.790; 95% CI: 0.725-0.854, P &lt;0.001; forehead: AUC 0.816; 95% CI: 0.757-0.876, P &lt;0.001). The cut-off value of wrist measurement for detecting tympanic temperature ≥37.3C was 36.2C with a 86.4% sensitivity and a 67.0% specificity, and the best threshold of forehead measurement was also 36.2C with a 93.2% sensitivity and a 60.0% specificity. Conclusions: Wrist measurement is more stable than forehead measurement under different circumstance. Both measurements have great fever screening abilities for indoor patients. The cut-off value of both measurements was 36.2C.

To date, few data on immunologic features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. Methods In this single-centre retrospective study, a total of 21 patients with pneumonia who were laboratory-confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan Tongji hospital were included from Dec 19, 2019 to Jan 27, 2020. The immunologic characteristics as well as their clinical, laboratory, radiological features were compared between 11 severe cases and 10 moderate cases. Results Of the 21 patients with COVID-19, only 4 (19%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. 7 (33.3%) patients had underlying conditions. The average age of severe and moderate cases was 63.9 and 51.4 years, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70.0%) moderate cases were male. Common clinical manifestations including fever (100%, 100%), cough (70%, 90%), fatigue (100%, 70%) and myalgia (50%, 30%) in severe cases and moderate cases. PaO2/FiO2 ratio was significantly lower in severe cases (122.9) than moderate cases (366.2). Lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (7000 million/L) than moderate cases (11000 million/L). Alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and ferritin were significantly higher in severe cases (41.4 U/L, 567.2 U/L, 135.2 mg/L and 1734.4 ug/L) than moderate cases (17.6 U/L, 234.4 U/L, 51.4 mg/L and 880.2 ug /L). IL-2R, TNF-α and IL-10 concentrations on admission were significantly higher in severe cases (1202.4 pg/mL, 10.9 pg/mL and 10.9 pg/mL) than moderate cases (441.7 pg/mL, 7.5 pg/mL and 6.6 pg/mL). Absolute number of total T lymphocytes, CD4+T cells and CD8+T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were significantly lower in severe cases (332.5, 185.6 and 124.3 million/L) than moderate cases (676.5, 359.2 and 272.0 million/L). The expressions of IFN-γ by CD4+T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.6%) than moderate cases (23.6%). Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+T cells, resulting in significant decrease in number as well as IFN-γ production, which may be associated with disease severity. Together with clinical characteristics, early immunologic indicators including diminished T lymphocytes and elevated cytokines may serve as potential markers for prognosis in COVID-19.

We found that cities that suffered from SARS and have greater migration ties to the epicentre, Wuhan, had earlier, stronger and more durable public awareness of the outbreak. Our data indicate that forty-eight such cities developed awareness up to 19 days earlier than 255 comparable cities, giving them an opportunity to better prepare. This study suggests that it is important to consider memory of prior catastrophic events as they will influence the public response to emerging threats.

Limited data are available for pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy and the intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection. Methods: Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (ie, with maternal throat swab samples that were positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan 20 to Jan 31, 2020. Evidence of intrauterine vertical transmission was assessed by testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples. Breastmilk samples were also collected and tested from patients after the first lactation. Findings: All nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0 × 10⁹ cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus. Interpretation: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were similar to those reported for non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Findings from this small group of cases suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy.

Methods In this single center, observational study, We recruited all Death Cases with COVID-19 from Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 16, 2020 in Intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital.Demographics, basic diseases, X-ray/CT results, possible therapy strategies and test results when their entrance into admission, ICU and 48 h before death were collected and analyzed. Results This study involved 101 COVID-19 dead cases in Intensive care unit of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital.47 patients went directly to the ICU because of critical condition, and 54 patients were transferred to ICU with aggravated condition.57 (56.44%) were laboratory confirmed by RT-PCR, and 44 (43.6%) were consistent with clinical diagnostic criteria.The cases included 64 males and 37 females with average age of 65.46 years (SD 9.74). The blood type distribution was significantly different, with type A 44.44%, type B 29.29%, type AB 8.08% and type O 18.19%.The clinical manifestations of new coronavirus pneumonia are non-specific,the common symptom was fever (91 [90.10%] of 101 patients),Cough (69[68.32%]) and dyspnea (75[74.26%]). Neutrophils, PCT, CRP,IL-6,D-dimer gradually increased as time went on.Myocardial enzymes were abnormal in most patients at admission,with the progress of the disease, myocardial damage indicators were significantly increased.61(60.40%) used antiviral drugs,59(58.42%) used glucocorticoids, 63.37% used intravenous immunoglobulins, and 44.55% used thymosin preparations. All patients received antibiotic treatment, 63(62.38%) used restricted antibiotics, 23(22.78%) used antifungal drugs.84(83.17%) used non-invasive ventilator or high-flow oxygen therapy equipment, and 76.24% used invasive mechanical ventilation. 7 patients were treated with ECMO and 8 patients were treated with CRRT.The median time from ARDS to invasive mechanical ventilation was 3.00 days(IQR 0.00-6.00). The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation was 5 days (IQR2.00-8.00). Conclusions Critical COVID-19 can cause fatal respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure with high mortality rate. Heart may be the earliest damaged organ except the lungs. Secondary infection in the later period is worthy of attention.

Although 2019-nCoV can cause a severe respiratory illness like SARS and MERS, evidence from clinics suggested that 2019-nCoV is generally less pathogenic than SARS-CoV, and much less than MERS-CoV. The transmissibility of 2019-nCoV is still debated and needs to be further assessed. To avoid the 2019-nCoV outbreak turning into an epidemic or even a pandemic and to minimize the mortality rate, China activated emergency response procedures, but much remains to be learned about the features of the virus to refine the risk assessment and response. Here, the current knowledge in 2019-nCoV pathogenicity and transmissibility is summarized in comparison with several commonly known emerging viruses, and information urgently needed for a better control of the disease is highlighted.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Jun</author><author>Qi, Tangkai</author><author>Liu, Li</author><author>Ling, Yun</author><author>Qian, Zhiping</author><author>Li, Tao</author><author>Li, Feng</author><author>Xu, Qingnian</author><author>Zhang, Yuyi</author><author>Xu, Shuibao</author><author>Song, Zhigang</author><author>Zeng, Yigang</author><author>Shen, Yinzhong</author><author>Shi, Yuxin</author><author>Zhu, Tongyu</author><author>Lu, Hongzhou</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical progression of patients with COVID-19 in Shanghai, China.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of infection</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of infection</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>SARS-CoV-2</keyword><keyword>clinical characteristics</keyword><keyword>clinical progression</keyword><keyword>viral clearance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>J Infect</publisher><accession-num>32171869</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32171869</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;not added;reviewed</label><abstract>BACKGROUND Studies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have generally been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial clinical characteristics. We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS In this retrospective, single-center study, we included confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai. Final date of follow-up was February 25, 2020. RESULTS Of the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2-7) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 16(12-20) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8-11 days) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P&lt;0.0001). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10-12 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (P&lt;0.0001). In multivariate logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR]=1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR=0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS The majority of COVID-19 cases are mild. The clinical progression pattern suggests that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of CVOID-19.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Jun</author><author>Wu, Lianlian</author><author>Zhang, Jun</author><author>Zhang, Liang</author><author>Gong, Dexin</author><author>Zhao, Yilin</author><author>Hu, Shan</author><author>Wang, Yonggui</author><author>Hu, Xiao</author><author>Zheng, Biqing</author><author>Zhang, Kuo</author><author>Wu, Huiling</author><author>Dong, Zehua</author><author>Xu, Youming</author><author>Zhu, Yijie</author><author>Chen, Xi</author><author>Yu, Lilei</author><author>Yu, Honggang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deep learning-based model for detecting 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia on high-resolution computed tomography: a prospective study</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.25.20021568</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.25.20021568</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: Computed tomography (CT) is the preferred imaging method for diagnosing 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID19) pneumonia. Our research aimed to construct a system based on deep learning for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on high resolution CT, relieve working pressure of radiologists and contribute to the control of the epidemic. Methods: For model development and validation, 46,096 anonymous images from 106 admitted patients, including 51 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 55 control patients of other diseases in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, Hubei province, China) were retrospectively collected and processed. Twenty-seven consecutive patients undergoing CT scans in Feb, 5, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were prospectively collected to evaluate and compare the efficiency of radiologists against 2019-CoV pneumonia with that of the model. Findings: The model achieved a per-patient sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93.55%, accuracy of 95.24%, PPV of 84.62%, and NPV of 100%; a per-image sensitivity of 94.34%, specificity of 99.16%, accuracy of 98.85%, PPV of 88.37%, and NPV of 99.61% in retrospective dataset. For 27 prospective patients, the model achieved a comparable performance to that of expert radiologist. With the assistance of the model, the reading time of radiologists was greatly decreased by 65%. Conclusion: The deep learning model showed a comparable performance with expert radiologist, and greatly improve the efficiency of radiologists in clinical practice. It holds great potential to relieve the pressure of frontline radiologists, improve early diagnosis, isolation and treatment, and thus contribute to the control of the epidemic.

We investigated two patients who developed acute respiratory syndromes after independent contact history with this market. The two patients shared common clinical features including fever, cough, and multiple ground-glass opacities in the bilateral lung field with patchy infiltration. Here, we highlight the use of a low-input metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) approach on RNA extracted from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). It rapidly identified a novel coronavirus (named 2019-nCoV according to World Health Organization announcement) which was the sole pathogens in the sample with very high abundance level (1.5% and 0.62% of total RNA sequenced). The entire viral genome is 29,881 nt in length (GenBank MN988668 and MN988669, Sequence Read Archive database Bioproject accession PRJNA601736) and is classified into beta-coronavirus genus. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that 2019-nCoV is close to coronaviruses (CoVs) circulating in Rhinolophus (Horseshoe bats), such as 98.7% nucleotide identity to partial RdRp gene of bat coronavirus strain BtCoV/4991 (GenBank KP876546, 370 nt sequence of RdRp and lack of other genome sequence) and 87.9% nucleotide identity to bat coronavirus strain bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Evolutionary analysis based on ORF1a/1b, S, and N genes also suggests 2019-nCoV is more likely a novel CoV independently introduced from animals to humans.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Liwen</author><author>Deng, Chaohua</author><author>Chen, Xuhui</author><author>Zhang, Xian</author><author>Chen, Bo</author><author>Yu, Huimin</author><author>Qin, Yuanjun</author><author>Xiao, Ke</author><author>Zhang, Hong</author><author>Sun, Xufang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of 534 cases of COVID-19 in China: A cross-sectional study</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.12.20034678</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.12.20034678</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;not added;reviewed</label><abstract>Objective: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and is now pandemic all over the world. Previous study has reported several COVID-19 cases with conjunctivitis. However, the complete profiling of COVID-19 related ocular symptoms and diseases are still missing. We aim to investigate the ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients. Methods: A total of five hundred and thirty-four patients were recruited at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital. We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, ocular symptoms, systemic concomitant symptoms, eye drop medication, eye protections, radiologic findings, and SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR from questionnaires and electronic medical records. Results: The median age of patients was 40 and 50 years at Mobile Cabin Hospital and Tongji Hospital, respectively. Of 534 COVID-19 patients, 25 patients (4.68%) presented with conjunctival congestion and 3 patients had conjunctival congestion as the initial symptom. The average duration of conjunctival congestion was 4.9 ± 2.6 days (mean [SD]), ranging from 2 to 10 days. Dry eye (112, 20.97%), blurred vision (68, 12.73%), and foreign body sensation (63, 11.80%) ranked as the top three COVID-19 related ocular symptoms. Notably, a total of 332 COVID-19 patients (62%) had a hand-eye contact history. We also found that some COVID-19 patients had a history of eye disease, including conjunctivitis (33, 6.18%), dry eye (24, 4.49%), keratitis (14, 2.62%), cataract (9, 1.69%), and diabetic retinopathy (5, 0.94%). In consistent with previous studies, the most common clinical symptoms were fever, cough, and fatigue. Patients, 60.5% in Mobile Cabin Hospital and 67.5% in Tongji Hospital, respectively were confirmed with positive SARS-CoV-2 detection. Conclusions: Conjunctival congestion was one of the COVID-19 related ocular symptoms, which may have clinical diagnostic significance. It is essential to provide eye-care equipment and strengthen education on eye protection, as dirty hand-eye contact might be a high risk factor of COVID-19. Further detailed and comprehensive ophthalmological guidance is needed for COVID-19 control.

We aimed to further clarify the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital from Jan 1 to Jan 20, 2020. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and radiological features and laboratory data. Outcomes were followed up until Jan 25, 2020. FINDINGS: Of the 99 patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia, 49 (49%) had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market. The average age of the patients was 55·5 years (SD 13·1), including 67 men and 32 women. 2019-nCoV was detected in all patients by real-time RT-PCR. 50 (51%) patients had chronic diseases. Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (82 [83%] patients), cough (81 [82%] patients), shortness of breath (31 [31%] patients), muscle ache (11 [11%] patients), confusion (nine [9%] patients), headache (eight [8%] patients), sore throat (five [5%] patients), rhinorrhoea (four [4%] patients), chest pain (two [2%] patients), diarrhoea (two [2%] patients), and nausea and vomiting (one [1%] patient). According to imaging examination, 74 (75%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 14 (14%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity, and one (1%) patient had pneumothorax. 17 (17%) patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and, among them, 11 (11%) patients worsened in a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure. INTERPRETATION: The 2019-nCoV infection was of clustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities, and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to explore the applicability of the MuLBSTA score in predicting the risk of mortality in 2019-nCoV infection.

It is currently no specific viral protein targeted therapeutics yet. Viral nucleocapsid protein is a potential antiviral drug target, serving multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle. However, the structural information of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is yet to be clear. Herein, we have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Although overall structure is similar with other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct. Further comparison with mild virus type HCoV-OC43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential RNA binding pocket alongside the beta-sheet core. Complemented by in vitro binding studies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, guiding the design of novel antiviral agents specific targeting to SARS-CoV-2.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Tian-Mu</author><author>Rui, Jia</author><author>Wang, Qiu-Peng</author><author>Zhao, Ze-Yu</author><author>Cui, Jing-An</author><author>Yin, Ling</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A mathematical model for simulating the phase-based transmissibility of a novel coronavirus</title><secondary-title>Infectious Diseases of Poverty</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Infectious Diseases of Poverty</full-title></periodical><pages>24</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Infect Dis Poverty</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s40249-020-00640-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-020-00640-3</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Tianmu</author><author>Rui, Jia</author><author>Wang, Qiupeng</author><author>Zhao, Zeyu</author><author>Cui, Jing-An</author><author>Yin, Ling</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A mathematical model for simulating the transmission of Wuhan novel Coronavirus</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.19.911669</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.19.911669</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/19/2020.01.19.911669.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020. In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probable be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from a seafood market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People transmission network model. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Weilie</author><author>Lan, Yun</author><author>Yuan, Xiaozhen</author><author>Deng, Xilong</author><author>Li, Yueping</author><author>Cai, Xiaoli</author><author>Li, Liya</author><author>He, Ruiying</author><author>Tan, Yizhou</author><author>Deng, Xizi</author><author>Gao, Ming</author><author>Tang, Guofang</author><author>Zhao, Lingzhai</author><author>Wang, Jinlin</author><author>Fan, Qinghong</author><author>Wen, Chunyan</author><author>Tong, Yuwei</author><author>Tang, Yangbo</author><author>Hu, Fengyu</author><author>Li, Feng</author><author>Tang, Xiaoping</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Detectable 2019-nCoV viral RNA in blood is a strong indicator for the further clinical severity</title><secondary-title>Emerging Microbes &amp; Infections</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Emerging Microbes &amp; Infections</full-title></periodical><pages>469-473</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Emerg Microbes Infect</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/22221751.2020.1732837</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2020.1732837</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Xiaohua</author><author>Zhao, Binghong</author><author>Qu, Yueming</author><author>Chen, Yurou</author><author>Xiong, Jie</author><author>Feng, Yong</author><author>Men, Dong</author><author>Huang, Qianchuan</author><author>Liu, Ying</author><author>Yang, Bo</author><author>Ding, Jinya</author><author>Li, Feng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Detectable serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is closely associated with drastically elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) level in critically ill COVID-19 patients</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.29.20029520</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.29.20029520</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: Although the SARS-CoV-2 viral load detection of respiratory specimen has been widely used for novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) diagnosis, it is undeniable that serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid (RNAaemia) could be detected in a fraction of the COVID-19 patients. However, it is not clear that if the incidence of RNAaemia could be correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storm or with the specific class of patients. Methods: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (version 6) published by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load detection and serum IL-6 levels were determined. Except for routine statistical analysis, Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) analysis was used to establish a patient status prediction model based on real-time RT-PCR Ct value. Findings: The Result showed that cases with RNAaemia were exclusively confirmed in critically ill patients group and appeared to reflect the illness severity. Further more, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in critically ill patients, which is almost 10-folds higher than those in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the incidence of RNAaemia (R=0.902) and the vital signs of COVID-19 patients (R= -0.682). Interpretation: Serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is strongly associated with cytokine storm and can be used to predict the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that cytokine IL-6 should be considered as a therapeutic target in critically ill patients with excessive inflammatory response.

Suboptimal T and B cell responses can delay viral clearance in MERS and SARS patients. The role of leukomonocytes in viral clearance of COVID-19 patients is not yet well defined.Methods: From January 26 to February 28, 2020, an observational study was launched at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. We enrolled 25 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, whose throat-swab specimens were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by qRT-PCR. We comprehensively analyzed clinical records, counts of lymphocyte subsets including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, B cells and NK cells in the patients who successfully cleared SARS-CoV-2, and compared to those that failed to, after a standardized treatment of 8-14 days. Findings: In 25 enrolled COVID-19 patients, lymphopeniawas a common feature. After the treatment, 14 patients were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. The patients that cleared the infection had restored the numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cellsand B cells as compared to the still viral RNA positive patients, while the recovered patients had a higher count of leukomonocytes. Conclusions: By comparison of leukomonocytes counts in COVID-19 patients at different stages of the disease, we found that CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells and B cells appear to play important roles in viral clearance. The restoration of leukomonocytes counts from peripheral blood can be used as prognosis for the recovery of an COVID-19 infection. We propose that restoration of leukomonocytes counts can be added to the COVID-19 diagnostic guidanceas a criterion for releasing and discharging patients.

We aim to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patient with COVID-19 in Hunan which is adjacent to Hubei. Methods: In this double-center, observational study, we recruited all consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from January 23 to February 14, 2020 in two designated hospitals in Hunan province, China. Epidemiological and clinical data from patients' electronic medical records were collected and compared between mild, moderate and severe/critical group in detail. Clinical outcomes were followed up to February 20, 2020. Findings: 291 patients with COVID-19 were categorized into mild group (10.0%), moderate group (72.8%) and severe/critical group (17.2%). The median age of all patients was 46 years (49.8% were male). 86.6% patients had an indirect exposure history. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe/critical group (48.0% vs 17.2%, p=0.006) and moderate group (43.4% vs 17.2%, p=0.007) were higher than mild group. Fever (68.7%), cough (60.5%), and fatigue (31.6%) were common symptoms especially for severe and critical patients. Typical lung imaging finding were bilateral and unilateral ground glass opacity or consolidation. Leukopenia, lymphopenia and eosinopenia occurred in 36.1%, 22.7% and 50.2% patients respectively. Increased fibrinogen was detected in 45 of 58 (77.6%) patients with available results. 29 of 44 (65.9%) or 22 of 40 (55.0%) patients were positive in Mycoplasma pneumonia or Chlamydia pneumonia antibody test respectively. Compared with mild or moderate group, severe/critical group had a relative higher level of neutrophil, Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio, h-CRP, ESR, CK, CK-MB, LDH, D-dimer, and a lower level of lymphocyte, eosinophils, platelet, HDL and sodium (all p&lt;0.01). Most patients received antiviral therapy and Chinese Medicine therapy. As of February 20, 2020, 159 (54.6%) patients were discharged and 2 (0.7%) patients died during hospitalization. The median length of hospital stay in discharged patients was 12 days (IQR: 10-15). Interpretation: The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients in Hunan is different from patients in Wuhan. The proportion of patients that had been to Wuhan in severe/critical group and moderate group were higher than mild group. Laboratory and imaging examination can assist in the diagnosis and classification of COVID-19 patients.

All residues involved in the catalysis, substrate binding and dimerisation are 100% conserved. Comparison of the polyprotein PP1AB sequences showed 86% identity. The 3C-like cleavage sites on the coronaviral polyproteins are highly conserved. Based on the near-identical substrate specificities and high sequence identities, we are of the opinion that some of the previous progress of specific inhibitors development for the SARS-CoV enzyme can be conferred on its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart.  With the 3CL &lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; molecular model, we performed virtual screening for purchasable drugs and proposed 16 candidates for consideration. Among these, the antivirals ledipasvir or velpatasvir are particularly attractive as therapeutics to combat the new coronavirus with minimal side effects, commonly fatigue and headache.  The drugs Epclusa (velpatasvir/sofosbuvir) and Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) could be very effective owing to their dual inhibitory actions on two viral enzymes. &lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Yu</author><author>Liu, Qianyun</author><author>Guo, Deyin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Emerging coronaviruses: genome structure, replication, and pathogenesis</title><secondary-title>Journal of medical virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of medical virology</full-title></periodical><pages>10.1002/jmv.25681</pages><keywords><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Pathogenesis</keyword><keyword>Respiratory tract</keyword><keyword>Virus classification</keyword><keyword>Zoonoses</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><accession-num>31967327</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jmv.25681</electronic-resource-num><notes>31967327[pmid]</notes><research-notes>31967327[pmid]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31967327</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is causing an outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia in patients in Wuhan, a central city in China, is another warning of the risk of coronaviruses posed to public health.

Five millions of people had emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak. METHODS: The officially reported cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with ArcGIS and WinBUGS. Population migration data of Wuhan City and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number. FINDINGS: The 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in Hubei and other provinces of South China. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan provinces that are adjacent to Hubei. While Wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. Numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. The case numbers of different provinces and cities of Hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from Wuhan. Lockdown of 19 cities of Hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number. INTERPRETATION: Population emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source for other cities and provinces. Some cities with low case number but were in rapid increase. Due to the upcoming Spring Festival return transport wave, understanding of the trends of risks in different regions is of great significance for preparedness for both individuals and institutions.

The cause and consequence of the outbreak remain largely unknown as it is still in its early stage. As many aspects of the new virus are similar to SARS in 2003, knowledge, patterns and lessons of the SARS-CoV outbreak are valuable resources for responding to the Wuhan 2019-nCoV outbreak. Using epidemiological surveys and analyses from the early stage of the SARS outbreak, we assessed and compared the characteristics of those two outbreaks and predicted the possible outcome for the current 2019-nCoV outbreak. Like the SARS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV has a high human-to-human transmission capability and healthcare workers and family members are high risk populations. Because the early outbreak stage coincides with the Chinese spring festival travel rush, it is a challenge to prevent and control the spread of the virus. In this situation, the emergence and movement of a 2019-nCoV super-spreader is difficult to identify. Using the reported case data so far (as of Jan 23, 2019), a logistic model was built and the cumulative and daily counts of the 2019-nCoV cases were predicted. The cumulative counts of 2019-nCoV cases was estimated about 2-3 times the total number of SARS, and the peak incidence is predicted to be in early or middle February. Regional migration should be limited or prohibited to prevent emergence and movement of a super-spreader. There is an urgent need to establish enhanced surveillance and implement efficient measures nationwide to control this epidemic.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Zhaowei</author><author>Hu, Jijia</author><author>Zhang, Zongwei</author><author>Jiang, Shan</author><author>Wang, Tao</author><author>Shi, Zhengli</author><author>Zhang, Zhan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Caution: The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients at admission are changing</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.03.20030833</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.03.20030833</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background With the emergence of 4rd generation transmission, the prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has entered a new period. We aimed to report several changes in the clinical characteristics at admission of patients with COVID-19. Methods Clinical records and laboratory results of patients suffering from COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed and matched with the admission dates to analyze the changes in characteristics at the onset of illness. Results Of the 89 affected patients, 31 [34.8%] patients were admitted from January 16 to 22, and 58 [65.2%] were admitted from January 23 to 29. Patients were admitted with more systemic symptoms, such as fever (21 [67.7%] of 31), fatigue (13 [41.9%] of 31), and myalgia (7 [22.6%] of 31), before January 23. More patients (10 [32.3%] of 31) admitted before January 23 had a small amount of sputum production compared with a smaller proportion (4 [6.9%] of 58) of the patients admitted after January 23. Other symptoms, such as cough, nausea, diarrhea, and chest tightness, were not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, the group admitted before January 23 had a larger proportion of patients with reduced lymphocyte (13 [54.2%] of 24), CD3 (11 [54.4%] of 21), and CD8 (9 [42.9%] of 21) counts and elevated serum amyloid A (SAA, 18 [75%] of 24). Conclusions The initial symptoms of recently infected patients seem more insidious, indicating that the new coronavirus may gradually evolve into a virus similar to influenza and latent in asymptomatic carriers for a long time.

This study aims to assess the prevalence and impact of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. Method: We conducted a consecutive cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches following a major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020. Hematuria, proteinuria, serum creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters were extracted from the electronic hospitalization databases and laboratory databases. Incidence rate for acute kidney injury (AKI) was examined during the study period. Association between kidney impairment and in-hospital death was analyzed. Results: We included 710 consecutive COVID19 patients, 89 (12.3%) of whom died in hospital. The median age of the patients was 63 years (inter quartile range, 51-71), including 374 men and 336 women. On admission, 44% of patients have proteinuria hematuria and 26.9% have hematuria, and the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 15.5% and 14.1% respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 3.2% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney impairment have higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated serum creatinine, elevated urea nitrogen, AKI, proteinuria and hematuria was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, leukocyte count and lymphocyte count. Conclusion: The prevalence of kidney impairment (hematuria, proteinuria and kidney dysfunction) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was high. After adjustment for confounders, kidney impairment indicators were associated with higher risk of in-hospital death. Clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney impairment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

The model is calibrated on the evidence of internationally imported cases before the implementation of the travel quarantine of Wuhan. By assuming a generation time of 7.5 days, the reproduction number is estimated to be 2.4 [90% CI 2.2-2.6]. The median estimate for number of cases before the travel ban implementation on January 23, 2020 is 58,956 [90% CI 40,759 - 87,471] in Wuhan and 3,491 [90% CI 1,924 - 7,360] in other locations in Mainland China. The model shows that as of January 23, most Chinese cities had already received a considerable number of infected cases, and the travel quarantine delays the overall epidemic progression by only 3 to 5 days. The travel quarantine has a more marked effect at the international scale, where we estimate the number of case importations to be reduced by 80% until the end of February. Modeling results also indicate that sustained 90% travel restrictions to and from Mainland China only modestly affect the epidemic trajectory unless combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community. ### Competing Interest Statement All authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form at www.icmje.org/coi_disclosure.pdf and declare: no support from any organisation for the submitted work; MEH reports grants from National Institute of General Medical Sciences, during the conduct of the study; AV reports grants and personal fees from Metabiota inc., outside the submitted work; MC and APyP report grants from Metabiota inc., outside the submitted work; HY reports grants from Glaxosmithkline (China) Investment Co., Ltd, grants from Yichang HEC Changjiang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, grants from Sanofi Pasteur, grants from Shanghai Roche Pharmaceuticals Company, outside the submitted work.

However, 5,298 more patient were confirmed until 4-Mar. The purpose is to estimate and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures using mathematical modeling.

Methods: Deterministic mathematical model(SEIHR) has been established to suit the Korean outbreak. The number of confirmed patients in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province(Daegu/NGP), the main area of outbreak, were used. The first patient's symptom onset date was assumed on 22-Jan. We estimate the reproduction number(R), and the effect of preventive measures, assuming that the effect has been shown from 29-Feb. or 5-Mar.

Results: The estimated R in Hubei Province was 4.2655, while the estimated initial R in Korea was 0.5555, but later in Daegu/NGP, the value was between 3.4721 and 3.5428. When the transmission period decreases from 4 days to 2 days, the outbreak finished early, but the peak of the epidemic has increased, and the total number of patients has not changed much. If transmission rate decreases about 90% or 99%, the outbreak finished early, and the size of the peak and the total number of patients also decreased.

Conclusion: To early end of the COVID-19 epidemic, efforts to reduce the spread of the virus such as social distancing and mask wearing are absolutely crucial with the participation of the public, along with the policy of reducing the transmission period by finding and isolating patients as quickly as possible through efforts by the quarantine authorities.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chong, Ka Chun</author><author>Cheng, Wei</author><author>Zhao, Shi</author><author>Ling, Feng</author><author>Mohammad, Kirran N</author><author>Wang, Maggie Haitian</author><author>Zee, Benny Chung-ying</author><author>Wei, Lesley</author><author>Xiong, Xi</author><author>Liu, Hengyan</author><author>Wang, Jingxuan</author><author>Chen, Enfu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring Disease Transmissibility of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease in Zhejiang, China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.02.20028704</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.02.20028704</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>We monitored the transmissibility of 2019 novel coronavirus disease in Zhejiang accounting the transmissions from imported cases.

In this study, we examined Rt of COVID-19 and compared its transmissibility between different intervention periods in Hangzhou and Shenzhen. Methods: Daily aggregated counts of confirmed imported and local cases between January 1, 2020 and March 13, 2020 were analysed. A likelihood function was constructed to estimate Rt, accounting for imported cases. Results: Although Hangzhou had fewer number of cases than Shenzhen, Shenzhen had higher proportion of imported cases than Hangzhou (83% vs 29%). Since the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen was dominated by imported cases, Rt was kept below unity through time. On the contrary, Rt was greater than unity in Hangzhou from 16 January to 7 February due to the surge in local cases. Credits to the Wuhan lockdown and outbreak response measures following the local lockdown, Rt decreased steadily and dropped below unity in mid-February. Conclusion: The lockdown measures and local outbreak responses helped reduce the potential of local transmission in Hangzhou and Shenzhen. Meanwhile, cities with similar epidemic trend could have different transmission dynamics given the variation in imported cases.

Pharmaceutical solutions based upon virologic studies, at this point, remain inconclusive. In contrast, this paper looks towards epidemiological models during this phase of viral growth, in particular, by providing a responsive, timely model of the R value based on the previous few days' results. Such an R value, although bearing less statistical precision due to limited sampling, could allow R to become a more effective, responsive standalone measure of infectious transmission. It demonstrates that the R value can be used as a dynamic, time-dependent indicator without the use of curve-fitting, and also estimates the most recent R-value of the CoViD-19 outbreak to be about 4.29, based on the data from the previous 3 days.

Using an SEIR-type transmission model, we contrasted two alternate strategies by modeling the proportion of the population that needs to be protected from infection by one-time vaccination (assuming 100% effectiveness) or by testing with isolation and treatment of individuals within six, 24, or 48 hours of symptom onset. If R is currently 2.2, vaccination at the herd immunity coverage of 55% would drive R just below 1, but transmission could persist for years. Over 80% of coverage is required to end the epidemic in 6 months with population-wide vaccination. The epidemic could be ended in just under a year if testing with isolation and treatment reached 80% of symptomatically infected patients within 24 hours of symptom onset (assuming 10% asymptomatic transmission). The epidemic could be ended in six months if testing with isolation and treatment reached 90% of symptomatic patients. If 90% of symptomatic patients could be tested within six hours of symptoms appearing, the epidemic could be ended in under four months.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementGC acknowledges support from NSF grant 1414374 as part of the joint NSF-NIH-USDA Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

This virus is genetically similar to SARS coronavirus and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The outbreak was initially detected in Wuhan, a major city of China, but has subsequently been detected in other provinces of China. Travel-associated cases have also been reported in a few other countries. Outbreaks in health care workers indicate human-to-human transmission. Molecular tests for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. METHODS: We developed two 1-step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays to detect two different regions (ORF1b and N) of the viral genome. The primer and probe sets were designed to react with this novel coronavirus and its closely related viruses, such as SARS coronavirus. These assays were evaluated using a panel of positive and negative controls. In addition, respiratory specimens from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were tested. RESULTS: Using RNA extracted from cells infected by SARS coronavirus as a positive control, these assays were shown to have a dynamic range of at least seven orders of magnitude (2x10-4-2000 TCID50/reaction). Using DNA plasmids as positive standards, the detection limits of these assays were found to be below 10 copies per reaction. All negative control samples were negative in the assays. Samples from two 2019-nCoV-infected patients were positive in the tests. CONCLUSIONS: The established assays can achieve a rapid detection of 2019n-CoV in human samples, thereby allowing early identification of patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chung, Michael</author><author>Bernheim, Adam</author><author>Mei, Xueyan</author><author>Zhang, Ning</author><author>Huang, Mingqian</author><author>Zeng, Xianjian</author><author>Cui, Jiufa</author><author>Xu, Wenjian</author><author>Yang, Yang</author><author>Fayad, Zahi</author><author>Jacobi, Adam</author><author>Li, Kunwei</author><author>Li, Shaolin</author><author>Shan, Hong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CT Imaging Features of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)</title><secondary-title>Radiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Radiology</full-title></periodical><pages>200230</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><accession-num>32017661</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1148/radiol.2020200230</electronic-resource-num><notes>32017661[pmid]</notes><research-notes>32017661[pmid]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32017661</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>In this retrospective case series, chest CT scans of 21 symptomatic patients from China infected with the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) were reviewed with emphasis on identifying and characterizing the most common findings.

This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. Since its release in 2019, we have produced a number of typing tools for emergent viruses that have caused large outbreaks, such as Zika and Yellow Fever Virus in Brazil. Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for 2019-nCoV. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clifford, Samuel J</author><author>Klepac, Petra</author><author>Zandvoort, Kevin Van</author><author>Quilty, Billy J</author><author>group, CMMID nCoV working</author><author>Eggo, Rosalind M</author><author>Flasche, Stefan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interventions targeting air travellers early in the pandemic may delay local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.12.20022426</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.12.20022426</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Objectives: To determine if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a previously unaffected country. Design: Simulation study Setting: Countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission and with no shared border with affected regions Participants: Infected air travellers Interventions: Syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival &amp; traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset. Main outcome measures: The achievable delay until a major local outbreak is likely to occur Results: We evaluated traveller sensitisation effectiveness in reducing the number of secondary cases of 30, 50 and 70%, and assumed either 1, 10, or 100 infected travellers per week. Early in the outbreak when only few infected travellers arrive, traveller sensitisation can delay a major outbreak in a previously unaffected region. For 50% sensitisation effectiveness, and assuming 1 infected traveller per week, we find that in 75% of simulations the outbreak is delayed by at least 11 days (97.5% of simulations: at least 7 days). The possible delay decreases rapidly for more travellers, lower effectiveness of sensitisation, higher R0 or lower heterogeneity thereof. Syndromic traveller screening at departure and/or arrival can further enhance outbreak delays. In combination with sensitisation, syndromic screening can delay an outbreak substantially longer. In 75% of simulations we find an outbreak delay of at least 111 days (97.5% of simulations: at least 23 days) for 1 infected traveller per week and at least 9 days (97.5% of simulations: at least 4 days) for 10 infected travellers per week. Conclusion: Air-traveller targeted interventions, particularly in combination, can delay local SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in the magnitude of a few weeks to potentially even months if the number of infected travellers remains low.

In this study we estimated the most vulnerable areas in Brazil for COVID-19, both in terms of risk of introduction and risk of mortality associated with social vulnerability. We explore the most likely routes of spread through the country, from the already exposed cities, according to human mobility statistics. The resulting maps should help authorities in their efforts to prioritize actions and if resource allocation to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.

Partial lifting of the ban is being considered, given the decline in incidence of COVID-19 in China. We modelled three scenarios to test the impact of travel bans on epidemic control in Australia. Scenario one was no ban, scenario two was the current ban, scenario three was a partial lifting of the current ban to allow over 100,000 university students to enter Australia, but not tourists. We used disease incidence data from China and air travel passenger movements between China and Australia, derived from incoming passenger arrival cards. We estimated the true incidence of disease in China using data on expected proportion of under-ascertainment of cases. We used an age specific deterministic model divided in 18 age stratified groups to model the epidemic in each scenario. The modelled epidemic with the full ban fitted the observed incidence of cases well. The modelled epidemic of the current ban predicts 57 cases on March 6th in Australia, compared to 66 observed on this date. The modelled impact without a travel ban implemented on February the 1st shows the epidemic would continue for more than a year resulting in more than 2000 cases and about 400 deaths. The impact of a partial lifting of a ban is minimal, and may be safe to consider. Travel restrictions were highly effective for containing the COVID-19 epidemic in Australia and averted a much larger epidemic. The epidemic is still containable if other measures are used in tandem as cases surge in other countries. This research can inform decisions on placing or lifting travel bans as a control measure for the COVID-19 epidemic.

We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioral changes on the incidence of COVID-19 as well as on influenza virus infections which may share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed policy interventions and measured changes in population behaviours through two telephone surveys, on January 20-23 and February 11-14. We analysed data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, influenza surveillance data in outpatients of all ages, and influenza hospitalisations in children. We estimated the daily effective reproduction number (R_t), for COVID-19 and influenza A(H1N1). Findings: COVID-19 transmissibility has remained at or below 1, indicating successful containment to date. Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% confidence interval, CI: 34% to 53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, and a 33% (95% CI: 24% to 43%) reduction in transmissibility based on paediatric hospitalization rates. In the two surveys we estimated that 74.5% and 97.5% of the general adult population wore masks when going out, and 61.3% and 90.2% avoided going to crowded places, respectively. Implications: Containment measures, social distancing measures and changes in population behaviour have successfully prevented spread of COVID-19. The social distancing measures and behavioural changes led to a substantial reduction in influenza transmission in early February 2020. However, it may be challenging to avoid fatigue and sustain these measures and population behaviours as COVID-19 continues to spread globally. Funding: Health and Medical Research Fund, Hong Kong

However, the swiftly spreading virus also caused an unprecedentedly rapid response from the research community facing the unknown health challenge of potentially enormous proportions. Unfortunately, the experimental research to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the viral infection and to design a vaccine or antivirals is costly and takes months to develop. To expedite the advancement of our knowledge we leverage the data about the related coronaviruses that is readily available in public databases, and integrate these data into a single computational pipeline. As a result, we provide a comprehensive structural genomics and interactomics road-maps of 2019-nCoV and use these information to infer the possible functional differences and similarities with the related SARS coronavirus.

This virus rapidly spreads to 33 countries worldwide. Thus, in order to effectively block its transmission, it is urgent to uncover all of the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2. Methods：From January 28 to February 18, 2020, 35 female patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Tongji Hospital were included in this descriptive study. The gynecologic history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) of all patients were recorded in detail. To examine whether there is sexual transmission, we employed real-time polymerase chain reaction testing (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in vaginal environment (including vaginal discharge, cervical or vaginal residual exfoliated cells) and anal swab samples, and inquired recent sexual behaviors from the patients. Findings：The average age of the 35 patients with COVID-19 was 61.5 years old (SD =11.2). Over 50% patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 had chronic diseases. We tested the vaginal environment and anal swabs from the 35 female patients with COVID-19, and found that only an anal swab sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. All the samples from vaginal environment were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, two female patients had sex with their partners during a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection incubation period, while one patient's partner was uninfected and the other patient's partner was diagnosed with COVID-19 (after the diagnosis of the female patient). Interpretation: The results from this study show no evidence of sexual transmission of SARS-CoV-2. No positive RT-PCR result was found in the vaginal environment perhaps due to the lack of ACE2 expression, which is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in the vagina and cervix tissues (human protein atlas). ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Clinical Trial ChiCTR2000029981 ### Funding Statement This work was financially supported by the Clinical Research Pilot Project of Tongji hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (No. 2019CR205). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

The knowledge of the 3D structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins can facilitate the development of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules. Specifically, comparative analyses of the structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and homologous proteins from previously characterized viruses, such as SARS-CoV, can reveal the common and/or distinctive traits that underlie the mechanisms of recognition of cell receptors and of molecules of the immune system. Herein, we apply our recently developed energy-based methods for the prediction of antibody-binding epitopes and protein-protein interaction regions to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Our analysis focusses only on the study of the structure of RBDs in isolation, without making use of any previous knowledge of binding properties. Importantly, our results highlight structural and sequence differences among the regions that are predicted to be immunoreactive and bind/elicit antibodies. These results provide a rational basis to the observation that several SARS-CoV RDB-specific monoclonal antibodies fail to appreciably bind the SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. Furthermore, we correctly identify the region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD that is engaged by the cell receptor ACE2 during viral entry into host cells. The data, sequences and structures we present here can be useful for the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dai, Yuhong</author><author>Hu, Guangyuan</author><author>Xiong, Huihua</author><author>Qiu, Hong</author><author>Yuan, Xianglin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak on healthcare workers in China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.03.20030874</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.03.20030874</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Introduction Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), more than 3000 (including clinical diagnosis) healthcare workers (HCWs) have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China. This study is aimed to investigate the risk perception and immediate psychological state of HCWs in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods This study utilized a cross-sectional survey designed on a convenient sample of 4357 HCWs in China. Its data were collected using anonymous structured questionnaires distributed through social software. 6 questions were set to evaluate the participants' risk perception of COVID-19, and a General Health Questionnaire was used to identify the participants' immediate psychological status. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Risk perception and psychological status were compared by demographic characteristics and COVID-19 exposure experiences. Result A total of 4,600 questionnaires were distributed, and 4,357 qualified ones (94.7%) were collected. The main concerns of HCWs are: infection of colleagues (72.5%), infection of family members (63.9%), protective measures (52.3%) and medical violence (48.5%). And 39.1% of the HCWs had psychological distress, especially working in Wuhan, participating in frontline treatments, having been isolated and having family members or colleagues infected. Conclusions The finding indicating that, faced with the COVID-19 epidemic, HCWs, especially in Wuhan, were worried about the risks of infection and protective measures, resulting in psychological distress, so further actions should be taken.

The model indicates that Wuhan quarantine measures were effective but that alternative virus forms (gut tropism) and a second propagation route (through environment) was present. For Singapore and Shenzhen region the secondary route does not seem to be active yet. Adequate prevention measures taking into account both routes should be implemented.

As of 9 February 2020, cases have been reported in 25 countries, including probable cases of human-to-human transmission in England. Methods: We adapted an existing national-scale metapopulation model to capture the spread of CoVID-19 in England and Wales. We used 2011 census data to capture population sizes and population movement, together with parameter estimates from the current outbreak in China. Results: We predict that a CoVID-19 outbreak will peak 126 to 147 days (~4 months) after the start of person-to-person transmission in England and Wales in the absence of controls, assuming biological parameters remain unchanged. Therefore, if person-to-person transmission persists from February, we predict the epidemic peak would occur in June. The starting location has minimal impact on peak timing, and model stochasticity varies peak timing by 10 days. Incorporating realistic parameter uncertainty leads to estimates of peak time ranging from 78 days to 241 days after person-to-person transmission has been established. Seasonal changes in transmission rate substantially impact the timing and size of the epidemic peak, as well as the total attack rate. Discussion: We provide initial estimates of the potential course of CoVID-19 in England and Wales in the absence of control measures. These results can be refined with improved estimates of epidemiological parameters, and permit investigation of control measures and cost effectiveness analyses. Seasonal changes in transmission rate could shift the timing of the peak into winter months, which will have important implications for healthcare capacity planning.

Given that the disease has not approved vaccines or drugs up to now, any efforts for drug design and or clinical trails of old drugs based on their mechanism of action are worthy and creditable in such circumstances. Experienced docking experiments using the newly released coordinate structure for COVID-19 protease as a receptor and thoughtfully selected chemicals among antiviral and antibiotics drugs as ligands may be leading in this context. We selected nine drugs from HIV-1 protease inhibitors and twenty-one candidates from anti bronchitis drugs based on their chemical structures and enrolled them in blind and active site-directed dockings in different modes and in native-like conditions of interactions. Our findings suggest the binding capacity and the inhibitory potency of candidates are as follows Tipranavir&gt;Indinavir&gt;Atazanavir&gt;Darunavir&gt;Ritonavir&gt;Amprenavir for HIV-1 protease inhibitors and Cefditoren&gt;Cefixime&gt;Erythromycin&gt;Clarithromycin for anti bronchitis medicines. The drugs bioavailability, their hydrophobicity and the hydrophobic properties of their binding sites and also the rates of their metabolisms and deactivations in the human body are the next determinants for their overall effects on viral infections, the net results that should survey by clinical trials to assess their therapeutic usefulness for coronavirus infections.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>De Salazar, Pablo M</author><author>Niehus, Rene</author><author>Taylor, Aimee</author><author>Buckee, Caroline O</author><author>Lipsitch, Marc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using predicted imports of 2019-nCoV cases to determine locations that may not be identifying all imported cases</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.04.20020495</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.04.20020495</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/05/2020.02.04.20020495.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Cases from the ongoing outbreak of atypical pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) exported from mainland China can lead to subsequent self-sustained outbreaks in other populations.

Remdesivir (GS-5734) effectively inhibited MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication in vitro, and showed efficacy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV in a mouse model. Here, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque. Prophylactic remdesivir treatment initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV−induced clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation of lung lesions. Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions. The data presented here support testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical trial. It may also be considered for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Deasy, Jacob</author><author>Rocheteau, Emma</author><author>Kohler, Katharina</author><author>Stubbs, Daniel J.</author><author>Barbiero, Peitro</author><author>Liò, Pietro</author><author>Ercole, Ari</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Forecasting ultra-early intensive care strain from COVID-19 in England</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.19.20039057</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.19.20039057</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented strain on intensive care unit (ICU) admission in parts of the world. Strategies to create surge ICU capacity requires complex local and national service reconfiguration and reduction or cancellation of elective activity. Theses measures require time to implement and have an inevitable lag before additional capacity comes on-line. An accurate short-range forecast would be helpful in guiding such difficult, costly and ethically challenging decisions. At the time this work began, cases in England were starting to increase. Here we present an attempt at an agile short-range forecast based on published real-time COVID-19 case data from the seven National Health Service commissioning regions in England (East of England, London, Midlands, North East and Yorkshire, North West, South East and South West). We use a Monte Carlo approach to model the likely impact of current diagnoses on regional ICU capacity over a 14 day horizon. Our model is designed to be parsimonious and based on plausible epidemiological data from the literature available. On the basis of the modelling assumptions made, ICU occupancy is likely to increase dramatically in the the days following the time of modelling. If the current exponential growth continues, 5 out of 7 commissioning regions will have more critically ill COVID-19 patients than there are ICU beds within two weeks\todo{last thing to do}. Despite variable growth in absolute patients, all commissioning regions are forecast to be heavily burdened under the assumptions used. Whilst, like any forecast model, there remain uncertainties both in terms of model specification and robust epidemiological data in this early prospective phase, it would seem that surge capacity will be required in the very near future. We hope that our model will help policy decision makers with their preparations. The uncertainties in the data highlight the urgent need for ongoing real-time surveillance to allow forecasts to be constantly updated using high quality local patient-facing data as it emerges.

It has already affected more than 300,000 people, with the number of deaths nearing 13000 across the world. As it has been posing a huge threat to global public health, it is of utmost importance to identify the rate at which the disease is spreading. In this study, we propose a time series model to analyze the trend pattern of the incidence of COVID-19 outbreak. We also incorporate information on total or partial lockdown, wherever available, into the model. The model is concise in structure, and using appropriate diagnostic measures, we showed that a time-dependent quadratic trend successfully captures the incidence pattern of the disease. We also estimate the basic reproduction number across different countries, and find that it is consistent except for the United States of America. The above statistical analysis is able to shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak, and gives insight on what epidemiological stage a region is in. This has the potential to help in prompting policies to address COVID-19 pandemic in different countries.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>DeCaprio, Dave</author><author>Gartner, Joseph A</author><author>Burgess, Thadeus</author><author>Kothari, Sarthak</author><author>Sayed, Shaayaan</author><author>McCall, Carol J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Building a COVID-19 Vulnerability Index</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.16.20036723</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.16.20036723</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>COVID-19 is an acute respiratory disease that has been classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Information regarding this particular disease is limited, however, it is known to have high mortality rates, particularly among individuals with preexisting medical conditions. Creating models to identify individuals who are at the greatest risk for severe complications due to COVID-19 will be useful to help for outreach campaigns in mitigating the diseases worst effects. While information specific to COVID-19 is limited, a model using complications due to other upper respiratory infections can be used as a proxy to help identify those individuals who are at the greatest risk. We present the results for three models predicting such complications, with each model having varying levels of predictive effectiveness at the expense of ease of implementation.

A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified to be accountable for this disease. Human-to-human transmission is confirmed, and this disease (named COVID-19 by World Health Organization (WHO)) spread rapidly around the country and the world. As of 18 February 2020, the number of confirmed cases had reached 75,199 with 2009 fatalities. The COVID-19 resulted in a much lower case-fatality rate (about 2.67%) among the confirmed cases, compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Among the symptom composition of the 45 fatality cases collected from the released official reports, the top four are fever, cough, short of breath, and chest tightness/pain. The major comorbidities of the fatality cases include hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cerebral infarction, and chronic bronchitis. The source of the virus and the pathogenesis of this disease are still unconfirmed. No specific therapeutic drug has been found. The Chinese Government has initiated a level-1 public health response to prevent the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, it is also crucial to speed up the development of vaccines and drugs for treatment, which will enable us to defeat COVID-19 as soon as possible.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Deng, Xiaowei</author><author>Yang, Juan</author><author>Wang, Wei</author><author>Wang, Xiling</author><author>Zhou, Jiaxin</author><author>Chen, Zhiyuan</author><author>Li, Jing</author><author>Chen, Yinzi</author><author>Yan, Han</author><author>Zhang, Juanjuan</author><author>Zhang, Yongli</author><author>Wang, Yan</author><author>Qiu, Qi</author><author>Gong, Hui</author><author>Wei, Xianglin</author><author>Wang, Lili</author><author>Sun, Kaiyuan</author><author>Wu, Peng</author><author>Ajelli, Marco</author><author>Cowling, Benjamin J.</author><author>Viboud, Cecile</author><author>Yu, Hongjie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Case fatality risk of novel coronavirus diseases 2019 in China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.04.20031005</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.04.20031005</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Objective The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) imposed a substantial health burden in mainland China and remains a global epidemic threat. Our objectives are to assess the case fatality risk (CFR) among COVID-19 patients detected in mainland China, stratified by clinical category and age group. Method We collected individual information on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases from publicly available official sources from December 29, 2019 to February 23, 2020. We explored the risk factors associated with mortality. We used methods accounting for right-censoring and survival analyses to estimate the CFR among detected cases. Results Of 12,863 cases reported outside Hubei, we obtained individual records for 9,651 cases, including 62 deaths and 1,449 discharged cases. The deceased were significantly older than discharged cases (median age: 77 vs 39 years, p&lt;0.001). 58% (36/62) were male. Older age (OR 1.18 per year; 95%CI: 1.14 to 1.22), being male (OR 2.02; 95%CI: 1.02 to 4.03), and being treated in less developed economic regions (e.g., West and Northeast vs. East, OR 3.93; 95%CI: 1.74 to 8.85) were mortality risk factors. The estimated CFR was 0.89-1.24% among all cases. The fatality risk among critical patients was 2-fold higher than that among severe and critical patients, and 24-fold higher than that among moderate, severe and critical patients. Conclusions Our estimates of CFR based on laboratory-confirmed cases ascertained outside of Hubei suggest that COVID-19 is not as severe as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, but more similar to the mortality risk of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in hospitalized patients. The fatality risk of COVID-19 is higher in males and increases with age. Our study improves the severity assessment of the ongoing epidemic and can inform the COVID-19 outbreak response in China and beyond.

Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of this virus is ongoing. SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) characterised by pulmonary infection in humans. The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials. Here we discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dey, Samrat Kumar</author><author>Rahman, Md.

Apart from the respiratory system, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can also directly infect other tissues such as the kidney or induce acute renal failure. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), plasma creatinine, and urea concentrations along with other clinical parameters from 85 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a hospital in Wuhan from January 17, 2020 to March 3, 2020. Kidney tissues from six other patients with postmortem examinations were analyzed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) and in situ expression of viral nucleocaspid protein (NP) antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS Among these 85 COVID-19 cases, 27.06% (23/85) patients exhibited acute renal failure (ARF), and elder patients (≥ 60 years old) are easier to develop ARF (65.22% vs 24.19%, p&lt; 0.001). Comorbidities of disorders like hypertension and heart failure were more common in patients who developed ARF (69.57% vs 11.29%, p&lt; 0.001). Dynamic observation of eGFR revealed that perished cases have a rapid decrease of eGFR but quickly boosting plasma creatinine and urea. On the other hand, enhancement of eGFR and persistence low level of plasma creatinine and urea was observed in recovery patients following diuretic treatment. H&amp;E staining demonstrated kidney tissues from 6 cases of postmortems have severe acute tubular necrosis but no evidence of glomerular pathology or tubulointerstitial lymphocyte infiltration. Immunohistochemistry showed that SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen was accumulated in kidney tubules. CONCLUSIONS The development of ARF during the course of disease is an important negative prognostic indicator for survival with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 virus directly infects human kidney tubules by thus induces acute tubular damage, ARF and probably also lead to urine transmission. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement The funding agencies did not participate in study design, data collection, data analysis, or manuscript writing. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the counts of total T cells, CD4+, CD8+ T cell subsets, and serum cytokine concentration from inpatient data of 522 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to January 2020, and 40 healthy controls, who came to the hospitals for routine physical examination. In addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 were measured by flow cytometry in the peripheral blood of 14 COVID-19 cases. RESULTS The number of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients, especially among elderly patients (≥60 years of age) and in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8+T cells or CD4+T cells lower than 800/μL, 300/μL, or 400/μL, respectively, are negatively correlated with patient survival. Statistical analysis demonstrated that T cell numbers are negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α concentration, with patients in decline period showing reduced IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α concentrations and restored T cell counts. Finally, T cells from COVID-19 patients have significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1 as compared to health controls. Moreover, increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells could be seen as patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages, further indicative of T cell exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS T cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted. Non-ICU patients, with total T cells, CD8+T cells CD4+T cells counts lower than 800/μL, 300/μL, and 400/μL, respectively, may still require aggressive intervention even in the immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for further deterioration in condition.

Theoretically, viral antigen is the specific marker of the virus and precedes antibody appearance within the infected population. There is a clear need of detection of viral antigen for rapid and early diagnosis. METHODS We included a cohort of 239 participants with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from 7 centers for the study. We measured nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal swab samples in parallel with the nucleic acid test. Nucleic acid test was taken as the reference standard, and statistical evaluation was taken in blind. We detected nucleocapsid protein in 20 urine samples in another center, employing nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test as reference standard. RESULTS We developed a fluorescence immunochromatographic assay for detecting nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample and urine within 10 minutes. 100% of nucleocapsid protein positive and negative participants accord with nucleic acid test for same samples. Further, earliest participant after 3 days of fever can be identified by the method. In an additional preliminary study, we detected nucleocapsid protein in urine in 73.6% of diagnosed COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS Those findings indicate that nucleocapsid protein assay is an accurate, rapid, early and simple method for diagnosis of COVID-19. Appearance of nucleocapsid protein in urine coincides our finding of the SARS-CoV-2 invading kidney and might be of diagnostic value.

However, due to the changing data of the epidemic, there is no scientific estimate of the cure rate and case fatality rate of the epidemic. This study proposes a method to estimate the cure rate and case fatality rate of COVID-19. The ratio of cumulative discharges on a given day to the sum of cumulative discharges on a given day and cumulative deaths before j days is used to estimate the cure rate. Moreover, the case fatality ratio can also be estimated. After simulation calculations, j is statistically appropriate when it is 8-10, and it is also clinically appropriate. When j is 9, based on the available data, it is inferred that the cure rate of this epidemic is about 93% and the case fatality rate is about 7%. This method of estimating the cure rate can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment in different medical schemes and different regions, and has great value and significance for decision-making in the epidemic.

Methods We collected demographic and epidemiological information of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hefei and Shenzhen between January 19 and February 11, 2020, from data officially published by the provincial and municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From these data we calculated basic reproduction number R0 to reflect the rate of spread of COVID-19 in these cities. Aggregated data of population migration during the same period was extracted from Baidu Migration. The change of R0 in the two cites were analyzed and compared. Spearman correlation analysis between R0 and population inflow from epidemic focus were performed. Results A total of 157 confirmed cases was identified in Hefei by 24:00 February 11, 2020, with an average age of 44.4±15.6 years, 74 female (47.1%) and 386 confirmed cases were identified in Shenzhen, with an average age of 45.15±17.99 years, 202 female (52.3%). Significant difference in the proportion of imported cases between the two cities was observed (Hefei vs Shenzhen, 24.2% vs 74.9%, p=0.000). Before January 31 2020, during the initial stage of the Level 1 Response to Major Public Health Emergencies, there was no significant association observed in Shenzhen between R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P =0.260, r=-0.452); meanwhile in Hefei, such association was strong (P =0.000, r=1.0). However, after the initial stage of response, the situation reversed. A weak association was observed in Shenzhen between be R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P=0.073, r=0.536) but not in Hefei (P =0.498, r=0.217). Conclusion Following Level 1 Response, consistent decline of R0 of COVID-19 was observed in both Hefei and Shenzhen. Different patterns of disease spread were observed in the two cities, driven by different patterns of population migration. This indicated that population migration should be taken into consideration when we set controlling policy of a novel infectious disease.

Structure analysis of the spike (S) protein of this new virus showed that its S protein only binds weakly to the ACE2 receptor on human cells whereas the human SARS coronavirus exhibits strongly affinity to the ACE receptor. These findings suggest that the new virus does not readily transmit between humans and should theoretically not able to cause very serious human infection. These data are important to guide design of infection control policy and inform the public on the nature of threat imposed by 2019-nCov when results of direct laboratory tests on this virus are not expected to be available in the near future.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dorigatti, Ilaria</author><author>Okell, Lucy</author><author>Cori, Anne</author><author>Imai, Natsuko</author><author>Baguelin, Marc</author><author>Bhatia, Sangeeta</author><author>Boonyasiri, Adhiratha</author><author>Cucunubá, Zulma</author><author>Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina</author><author>Fitzjohn, Rich</author><author>Fu, Han</author><author>Gaythorpe, Katy</author><author>Hamlet, Arran</author><author>Hinsley, Wes</author><author>Hong, Nan</author><author>Kwun, Min</author><author>Laydon, Daniel</author><author>Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma</author><author>Riley, Steven</author><author>Van Elsland, Sabine</author><author>Volz, Erik</author><author>Wang, Haowei</author><author>Wang, Raymond</author><author>Walters, Caroline</author><author>Xi, Xiaoyue</author><author>Donnelly, Christl</author><author>Ghani, Azra</author><author>Ferguson, Neil</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Report 4: Severity of 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV)</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Dorigatti et al. - Unknown - Report 4 Severity of 2019-novel coronavirus (nCoV).pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;report;reviewed</label><abstract>We present case fatality ratio (CFR) estimates for three strata of 2019-nCoV infections. For cases detected in Hubei, we estimate the CFR to be 18% (95% credible interval: 11%-81%). For cases detected in travellers outside mainland China, we obtain central estimates of the CFR in the range 1.2-5.6% depending on the statistical methods, with substantial uncertainty around these central values. Using estimates of underlying infection prevalence in Wuhan at the end of January derived from testing of passengers on repatriation flights to Japan and Germany, we adjusted the estimates of CFR from either the early epidemic in Hubei Province, or from cases reported outside mainland China, to obtain estimates of the overall CFR in all infections (asymptomatic or symptomatic) of approximately 1% (95% confidence interval 0.5%-4%). It is important to note that the differences in these estimates does not reflect underlying differences in disease severity between countries. CFRs seen in individual countries will vary depending on the sensitivity of different surveillance systems to detect cases of differing levels of severity and the clinical care offered to severely ill cases. All CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously at the current time as the sensitivity of surveillance of both deaths and cases in mainland China is unclear. Furthermore, all estimates rely on limited data on the typical time intervals from symptom onset to death or recovery which influences the CFR estimates.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dowd, Jennifer Beam</author><author>Rotondi, Valentina</author><author>Adriano, Liliana</author><author>Brazel, David M</author><author>Block, Per</author><author>Ding, Xuejie</author><author>Liu, Yan</author><author>Mills, Melinda C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Demographic science aids in understanding the spread and fatality rates of COVID-19</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.15.20036293</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.15.20036293</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Governments around the world must rapidly mobilize and make difficult policy decisions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Because deaths have been concentrated at older ages, we highlight the important role of demography, particularly how the age structure of a population may help explain differences in fatality rates across countries and how transmission unfolds. We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider both the age composition of local and national contexts as well as the social connectedness of older and younger generations. We also call for countries to provide case and fatality data disaggregated by age and sex to improve real-time targeted nowcasting.

The number of diagnosed cases is more than 40,000 until the submission of this manuscript. Coronavirus has caused several epidemic situations world widely, but the present contagious disease caused by 2019 new coronavirus is unprecedentedly fulminating. The published cohorts of 2019 new coronavirus (n-Cov) are single-center studies, or retrospective studies. We here share the therapeutic experiences of NCP treatment with literature review. Combination of Ribavirin and interferon-α is recommended by the 5(th) edition National Health Commission's Regimen (Revised Edition) because of the effect on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the effectiveness of Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Remdisivir needs to be confirmed by randomized controlled trial (RCT), given the situation of no specific antivirus drug on NCP is unavailable. Systemic glucocorticosteroid is recommended as a short term use (1~2 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1), 3~5 d) by the 5(th) edition National Health Commission's Regimen (Revised Edition) yet RCTs are expected to confirm the effectiveness. Inappropriate application of antibiotics should be avoided, especially the combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics, for the NCP is not often complicated with bacterial infection. 新型冠状病毒肺炎（new coronavirus pneumonia，NCP）正在中国引起严重疫情，截至发稿之日，全国确诊人数已逾4万。冠状病毒已经在全世界范围内引起数次疫情，但此次疫情的来势之迅猛及传染性之强前所未有。我们对引起此次疫情的病原体——2019新型冠状病毒知之甚少，目前在国际上发表的临床研究文章或为单中心研究，或为回顾性分析。我们结合在新冠肺炎一线的救治体会及相关发表的研究成果，给大家分享新冠肺炎的治疗经验。抗病毒药物方面，目前仍无特效药物，利巴韦林和干扰素联合用药由于其治疗中东呼吸综合征（MERS）有效，仍被我国新冠肺炎诊疗方案推荐；洛匹那韦/利托那韦和瑞德西韦的疗效有待随机对照临床试验（randomized controlled trial，RCT）评价；糖皮质激素的短期应用（1~2 mg·kg(-1)·d(-1)，3~5 d）被我国诊疗方案推荐，但仍需RCT进一步证实；本次新冠肺炎合并细菌感染较少，应当避免盲目使用抗菌药物，尤其避免联用广谱抗菌药物。.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Du, Zhanwei</author><author>Wang, Lin</author><author>Cauchemez, Simon</author><author>Xu, Xiaoke</author><author>Wang, Xianwen</author><author>Cowling, Benjamin J.</author><author>Meyers, Lauren Ancel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Risk of 2019 novel coronavirus importations throughout China prior to the Wuhan quarantine</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.28.20019299</pages><issue>Jan 30</issue><keywords><keyword>Wuhan</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>importation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.28.20019299</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Du et al. - 2020 - ​Risk of 2019 novel coronavirus importations throughout China prior to the Wuhan.pdf</url><url>internal-pdf://Du et al. - 2020 - ​Risk of 2019 novel coronavirus importations throughout China prior to the Wuhan(2).pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019299v3.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>On January 23, 2020, China quarantined Wuhan to contain an emerging coronavirus (2019-nCoV).

We report our case series of 68 patients, reviewed by Infectious Diseases Consultants at a Regional Infectious Diseases Unit in the UK. We prospectively evaluated our service between the 29th Jan 2020 and 24th Feb 2020. Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were collected. We have compared clinical features and subsequent diagnosis between well patients not requiring admission for clinical reasons or antimicrobials with those assessed as needing either admission or antimicrobial treatment. Final microbiological diagnoses included SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), Mycoplasma pneumonia, influenza A, RSV, non SARS/MERS coronaviruses, rhinovirus/enterovirus. 9/68 were treated with antimicrobials, 15/68 were admitted to a negative pressure room of whom 5/68 were admitted solely due to an inability to isolate at home. Patients requiring either admission on clinical grounds or antimicrobials (14/68) were similar to those not requiring admission or antimicrobials, with modestly more fever and shortness of breath in the clinically admitted / antimicrobial group. The most commonly prescribed antimicrobials were doxycycline, moxifloxacin and oseltamivir. The majority of patients had mild illness which did not require a clinical intervention to manage. This finding supports a community testing approach supported by clinicians to review the proportion of more unwell patients.

More than 125000 confirmed cases and 4,607 death cases have been recorded around more than 118 countries. Unfortunately, a coronavirus vaccine is expected to take at least 18 months if it works at all. Moreover, COVID -19 epidemics can mutate into a more aggressive form. Day level information about the COVID -19 spread is crucial to measure the behavior of this new virus globally. Therefore, this study presents a comparison of day level forecasting models on COVID-19 affected cases using time series models and mathematical formulation. The forecasting models and data strongly suggest that the number of coronavirus cases grows exponentially in countries that do not mandate quarantines, restrictions on travel and public gatherings, and closing of schools, universities, and workplaces (Social Distancing).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Errett, Nicole A</author><author>Sauer, Lauren M</author><author>Rutkow, Lainie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An integrative review of the limited evidence on international travel bans as an emerging infectious disease disaster control measure</title><secondary-title>Journal of emergency management (Weston, Mass.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of emergency management (Weston, Mass.)</full-title></periodical><pages>7-14</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>10.5055/jem.2020.0446</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031668</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>In our increasingly interconnected world, the potential for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) to spread globally is of paramount concern. Travel bans-herein defined as the complete restriction of travel from at least one geographic region to at least one other international geographic region-are a potential policy solution to control the global spread of disease. The social, economic, and health-related consequences of travel bans, as well as the available evidence on the effectiveness of travel restrictions in preventing the global spread of influenza, have been previously described. However, the effectiveness of travel bans in reducing the spread of noninfluenza EIDs, characterized by different rates and modes of transmission, is less well understood. This study employs an integrative review approach to summarize the minimal evidence on effectiveness of travel bans to decrease the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola virus disease (EVD), and Zika virus disease (ZVD). We describe and qualify the evidence presented in six modeling studies that assess the effectiveness of travel bans in controlling these noninfluenza EID events. We conclude that there is an urgent need for additional research to inform policy decisions on the use of travel bans and other control measures to control noninfluenza EIDs in advance of the next outbreak.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eurosurveillance Editorial, Team</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Note from the editors: World Health Organization declares novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) sixth public health emergency of international concern</title><secondary-title>Euro Surveill</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Euro Surveill</full-title></periodical><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>1025-496x</isbn><accession-num>32019636</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.5.200131e</electronic-resource-num><notes>1560-7917

ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells, which also happens in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Several researches have indicated that some patients have abnormal renal function or even kidney damage in addition to injury in respiratory system, and the related mechanism is unknown. This arouses our interest in whether coronavirus infection will affect the urinary and male reproductive systems. Here in this study, we used the online datasets to analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs. The results indicate that ACE2 highly expresses in renal tubular cells, Leydig cells and cells in seminiferous ducts in testis. Therefore, virus might directly bind to such ACE2 positive cells and damage the kidney and testicular tissue of patients. Our results indicate that renal function evaluation and special care should be performed in 2019-nCoV patients during clinical work, because of the kidney damage caused by virus and antiviral drugs with certain renal toxicity. In addition, due to the potential pathogenicity of the virus to testicular tissues, clinicians should pay attention to the risk of testicular lesions in patients during hospitalization and later clinical follow-up, especially the assessment and appropriate intervention in young patients' fertility.

We found that the distribution of Wuhan’s migrants is centred in Hubei Province (approximately 75%) at a provincial level, gradually decreasing in the surrounding provinces in layers, with obvious spatial characteristics of circle layers and echelons. The scale of Wuhan’s migrants, whose origins in Hubei Province give rise to a gradient reduction from east to west within the province, and account for 66% of Wuhan’s total migrants, are from the surrounding prefectural-level cities of Wuhan. The distribution comprises 94 districts and counties in Hubei Province, and the cumulative percentage of the top 30 districts and counties exceeds 80%. Wuhan’s migrants have a large proportion of middle-aged and high-risk individuals. Their social characteristics include nuclear family migration (84%), migration with families of 3–4 members (71%), a rural household registration (85%), and working or doing business (84%) as the main reason for migration. Using a quasi-experimental analysis framework, we found that the size of Wuhan’s migrants was highly correlated with the daily number of confirmed cases. Furthermore, we compared the epidemic situation in different regions and found that the number of confirmed cases in some provinces and cities in Hubei Province may be underestimated, while the epidemic situation in some regions has increased rapidly. The results are conducive to monitoring the epidemic prevention and control in various regions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fan, Hua-Hao</author><author>Wang, Li-Qin</author><author>Liu, Wen-Li</author><author>An, Xiao-Ping</author><author>Liu, Zhen-Dong</author><author>He, Xiao-Qi</author><author>Song, Li-Hua</author><author>Tong, Yi-Gang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Repurposing of clinically approved drugs for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 in a 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) related coronavirus model.</title><secondary-title>Chinese medical journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chinese medical journal</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Chin Med J (Engl)</publisher><accession-num>32149769</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/CM9.0000000000000797</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32149769</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>BACKGROUND Medicines for the treatment of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections are urgently needed. However, drug screening using live 2019-nCoV requires high-level biosafety facilities, which imposes an obstacle for those without such facilities or 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This study aims to repurpose the clinically approved drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a 2019-nCoV related coronavirus model. METHODS A 2019-nCoV related pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V/pangolin/2017/ Guangxi was described. Whether GX_P2X uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the cell receptor was investigated by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of ACE2. The pangolin coronavirus model was used to identify drug candidates for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Two libraries of 2406 clinically approved drugs were screened for their ability to inhibit cytopathic effects on Vero E6 cells by GX_P2X infection. The antiviral activities and antiviral mechanisms of potential drugs were further investigated. Viral yields of RNAs and infectious particles were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and plaque assay, respectively. RESULTS The spike protein of coronavirus GX_P2V shares 92.2% amino acid identity with that of 2019-nCoV isolate Wuhan-hu-1, and uses ACE2 as the receptor for infection just like 2019-nCoV. Three drugs-cepharanthine (CEP), selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride exhibited complete inhibition of cytopathic effects in cell culture at 10 μmol/L. CEP demonstrated the most potent inhibition of GX_P2V infection, with a concentration for 50% of maximal effect [EC50] of 0.98 μmol/L. The viral RNA yield in cells treated with 10 μmol/L CEP was 15,393-fold lower than in cells without CEP treatment ([6.48 ± 0.02] × 10vs. 1.00 ± 0.12, t = 150.38, P &lt; 0.001) at 72 h post-infection (p.i.). Plaque assays found no production of live viruses in media containing 10 μmol/L CEP at 48 h p.i. Furthermore, we found CEP has potent antiviral activities against both viral entry (1.00 ± 0.37 vs. 0.46 ± 0.12, t = 2.42, P &lt; 0.05) and viral replication (1.00 ± 0.43 vs. [6.18 ± 0.95] × 10, t = 3.98, P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Our pangolin coronavirus GX_P2V is a workable model for 2019-nCoV research. CEP, selamectin and mefloquine hydrochloride are potential drugs for treating 2019-nCoV infection. Our results strongly suggest that CEP is a wide-spectrum inhibitor of pan-betacoronavirus, and clinical trial of CEP for treatment of 2019-nCoV infection is warranted.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fan, Jingchun</author><author>Liu, Xiaodong</author><author>Pan, Weimin</author><author>Douglas, Mark W</author><author>Bao, Shisan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiology of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease-19 in Gansu Province, China, 2020.</title><secondary-title>Emerging infectious diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Emerging infectious diseases</full-title></periodical><volume>26</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Emerg Infect Dis</publisher><accession-num>32168465</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3201/eid2606.200251</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32168465</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;not added;reviewed</label><abstract>To determine the epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in a remote region of China, far from Wuhan, we analyzed the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Gansu Province.

Characteristics that differed significantly during the first and second waves of illness in Gansu Province were mean patient age, occupation, having visited epidemic areas, and mode of transportation. Time from infection to illness onset for family clusters was shorter in Gansu Province than in Wuhan, consistent with shortened durations from onset to first medical visit or hospitalization.

Abnormal liver functions are frequently present in these patients, here we aimed to clarify the clinical features of COVID-19-related liver damage to provide some references for the clinical treatment. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included all confirmed COVID-19 cases in Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20 to January 31, 2020. The outcomes were followed up until February 19, 2020. A total of 148 cases were analyzed for clinical features, laboratory parameters (including liver function tests), medications and the length of stay. FINDINGS: Of 148 confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, 49.3% were females and 50.7% were males. The median age was 50.5 years (interquartile range, 36-64). Patients had clinical manifestations of fever (70.1%), cough (45.3%), expectoration (26.7%) at admission. 75 patients (50.7%) showed abnormal liver functions at admission, characterized by an increased of 具体那些升高alt, ast, GGT, AKP等. Patients (n = 75) who had elevated liver function index were more likely to have a moderate-high degree fever (44% vs 27.4%; p = 0.035) and significantly present in male patients (62.67% vs 38.36%; p = 0.005). The numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly lower in abnormal liver function group than those in normal liver function group. There was no statistical difference in prehospital medications between normal and abnormal liver function groups, while the utilization rate of lopinavir/ritonavir after admission was significantly higher in patients with emerging liver injury than that in patients with normal liver functions. Importantly, the emerging abnormal liver functions after admission caused a prolonged length of stay. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 may cause the liver function damage and the Lopinavir/ritonavir should be applied carefully for the treatment of COVID-19.

A first analysis of simple day-lag maps points to some universality in the epidemic spreading, suggesting that simple mean-field models can be meaningfully used to gather a quantitative picture of the epidemic spreading, and notably the height and time of the peak of confirmed infected individuals. The analysis of the same data within a simple susceptible-(confirmed) infected-recovered-deaths model indicates that the kinetic parameter that describes the rate of recovery seems to be the same, irrespective of the country, while the infection and death rates appear to be more variable. The model places the peak in Italy around March 20$^{\rm th}$ 2020, with a maximum number of confirmed infected individuals of about 16,000.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fang, Bing</author><author>Liu, Linlin</author><author>Yu, Xiao</author><author>Li, Xiang</author><author>Ye, Guojun</author><author>Xu, Juan</author><author>Zhang, Ling</author><author>Zhan, Faxian</author><author>Liu, Guiming</author><author>Pan, Tao</author><author>Shu, Yilin</author><author>Jiang, Yongzhong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome-wide data inferring the evolution and population demography of the novel pneumonia coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.04.976662</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.04.976662</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Central China and rapidly spread throughout China. Up to March 3, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 89,000 people in China and other 66 countries across six continents. In this study, we used 10 new sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and combined 136 genomes from GISAID database to investigate the genetic variation and population demography through different analysis approaches (e.g. Network, EBSP, Mismatch, and neutrality tests) in the previous three months. The results showed that eighty haplotypes had 183 substitution sites, including 27 parsimony-informative and 156 singletons. Sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain range in mutations and variation in genomic abundance of SARS-CoV-2, which could be explaining the existing widespread and high adaptation of the deadly virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that pangolin may not be an intermediate host. The network indicated that, in the original haplotype (H14), one patient sample lived near the Huanan seafood market (approximately 2 km), which indicating high possibility of the patient having a history of unconscious contact with this market. However, based on this clue, we cannot accurately conclude that whether this market was the origin center of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, 16 genomes, collected from this market, assigned to 10 haplotypes, indicated a circulating infection within the market in a short term, which would have led to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and other areas. The EBSP results showed that the first estimated expansion date began from 7 December 2019, which indicated that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could have begun from person to person in mid to late November.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fang, F</author><author>Luo, X P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Facing the pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus infections: the pediatric perspectives]</title><secondary-title>Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi</full-title></periodical><pages>E001</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>0</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0578-1310 (Print)0578-1310</isbn><accession-num>32023678</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1310.2020.0001</electronic-resource-num><notes>Fang, F

We aimed to conduct a systematic review on scientific literatures and to synthesize critical data on clinical traits of COVID-19 from its initial outbreak to pandemic. METHODS Systematic searches were conducted to identify retrospective observational study that contained clinical characteristics on COVID-19 through multiple databases. Two reviewers independently evaluated eligible publications. Data on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS Seventy-two retrospective studies demonstrating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 were included. A total of 3470 COVID-19 patients were synthesized to the final analysis in an unbiased manner. The most common symptom was fever (2878 [83.0%]), and 63.4% of the patients presented fever as onset symptom. There were 2528 [88.2%] of 2866 cases had abnormal lung findings on chest CT scan. Laboratory findings showed that 1498 [62.8%] of 2387 cases had lymphopenia, and 1354 [64.8%] of 2091 cases had an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP). A total of 185 [11.5%] patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) while the overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 3.7%. Compared to patients admitted outside of Hubei, China, those from Hubei had a significant higher ICU admission rate (21.9% vs. 2.5%, p&lt;0.001). Also, CFR attributed to COVID-19 was significantly higher in Hubei than that of non-Hubei admissions (10.4% vs. 0.6%, p&lt;0.001). INTERPRETATION This large patient-based systematic review presents a more precise profiling of the COVID-19 from its outbreak to current pandemic. Dynamic evolvements of COVID-19 are needed to be characterized in future studies. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This systematic review presents independent research supported by the Shenzhen Science and Technology Peacock Team Project (Grant No. KQTD20170331145453160) and Shenzhen Nanshan District Pioneer Group Research Funds (Grant No. LHTD20180007) ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

No approved vaccine yet exists for 2019-nCoV or any form of coronavirus. Here we use computational tools from structural biology and machine learning to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell and B-cell epitopes based on viral protein antigen presentation and antibody binding properties. These epitopes can be used to develop more effective vaccines and identify neutralizing antibodies. We identified 405 viral peptides with good antigen presentation scores for both human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles, and two potential neutralizing B-cell epitopes near the 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor binding domain (440-460 and 494-506). Analyzing mutation profiles of 68 viral genomes from four continents, we identified 96 coding-change mutations. These mutations are more likely to occur in regions with good MHC-I presentation scores (p=0.02). No mutations are present near the spike protein receptor binding domain. We validated our computational pipeline with SARS-CoV experimental data.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Feng, Ye</author><author>Qiu, Min</author><author>Zou, Shengmei</author><author>Li, Yun</author><author>Luo, Kai</author><author>Chen, Rongchang</author><author>Sun, Yingqiang</author><author>Wang, Kui</author><author>Zhuang, Xinlei</author><author>Zhang, Shanshan</author><author>Chen, Shuqing</author><author>Mo, Fan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multi-epitope vaccine design using an immunoinformatics approach for 2019 novel coronavirus in China (SARS-CoV-2)</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.03.962332</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.03.962332</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>A new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, recently discovered in Wuhan, China, has caused over 74000 infection cases and 2000 deaths. Due to the rapidly growing cases and the unavailability of specific therapy, there is a desperate need for vaccines to combat the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we performed an in silico approach based on the available virus genome to identify the antigenic B-cell epitopes and human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) restricted T-cell epitopes. A total of 61 B-cell epitopes were initially identified, 19 of which with higher potential immunogenicity were used for vaccine design. 499 T-cell epitopes were predicted that showed affinity with the 34 most popular HLA alleles in Chinese population. Based on these epitopes, 30 vaccine candidates were designed and inspected against safety risks, including potential toxicity, human homologous, pharmaceutical peptides and bioactive peptides. Majority of vaccine peptides contained both B-cell and T-cell epitopes, which may interact with the most prevalent HLA alleles accounting for ~99% of Chinese population.

In conclusion, these putative antigenic peptides may elicit the resistance response to the viral infection.

Materials and Methods: 224 patients with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection outside Wuhan who had chest CT examinations were retrospectively screened. Clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. CT images were reviewed and scored for lesion distribution, lobe and segment involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. All included patients with moderate NCP were observed for at least 14 days from admission to determine whether they exacerbated to severe NCP (progressive group) or not (stable group). CT and clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for developing severe NCP. Results: A total of 141 patients with moderate NCP were included, of which 15 (10.6%) patients developed severe NCP during hospitalization and assigned to the progressive group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 [1.04-1.53]; P = 0.018) and CT severity score (OR and 95% CI, 1.25 [1.08-1.46]; P = 0.004) on admission were independent predictors for progression to severe NCP, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the consistent results in nonimported patients but not in imported patients. However, no significant difference in lung involvement was found on CT between imported and nonimported patients (all P &gt; 0.05). Patients who were admitted more than 4 days from symptom onset tended to have more severe lung involvement. Spearman correlation analysis showed the close association between CT severity score and inflammatory indexes (r = 0.17~0.47, all P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: CT severity score was associated with inflammatory levels and higher NLR and CT severity score on admission were independent risk factors for short-term progression in patients with NCP outside Wuhan. Furthermore, early admission and surveillance by CT should be recommended to improve clinical outcomes.

However a reliable estimation of the number of infected, including asymptomatic people, turns out to be crucial in the preparation of operational schemes and to estimate the future number of people, who will require, to different extents, medical attentions. In order to overcome the current data shortcoming, this paper proposes a bootstrap driven, estimation procedure for the number of people infected with the SARSCoV2. This method is designed to be robust, automatic and suitable to generate estimations at regional level. Obtained results show that, while official data at March the 12th report 12.839 cases in Italy, people infected wiyh the SARSCoV2 could be as high as 105.789.

The aim of non-pharmaceutical infection prevention is to move a population towards herd protection, a state where a population maintains R​&lt;​1, thus making it impossible for a pathogen to cause an epidemic. Here, we address epidemiological issues that affect the feasibility of an algorithmic approach to instantaneous contact tracing; ethical and implementation issues are addressed separately. First we quantify the parameters of COVID-19 in a framework that is consistent with the renewal equation formulation of epidemic spread. Second, we use an analytical solution to application of first-degree contact tracing in the renewal equation model to explore combinations of efficacy that can induce herd protection (R​&lt;​1). With the emergence of the novel viral pathogen SARS-CoV-2, of clear potential for a global pandemic with high fatality rates and incapacitated health systems, the question of prevention has critical priority. We come to the conclusion that isolating symptomatic cases and tracing their contacts in a classical manner is not sufficiently fast to stop the spread of the epidemic and needs to be accompanied by measures of social distancing that are disruptive to a wide number of people. We show that first-degree instantaneous contact tracing, informing users when they can move safely or when to seek medical help and avoid vulnerable individuals, has the potential to stop the spread of the epidemic if used by a sufficiently large number of people with reasonable fidelity.

First, we collect a global dataset on internet searches indicative of economic anxieties, which serve as a leading indicator of subsequent aggregate demand contractions. We find that the arrival of coronavirus in a country leads to a substantial increase in such internet searches of up to 58 percent. Second, to understand how information about the coronavirus drives economic anxieties, we conduct a survey experiment in a representative sample of the US population. We find that participants vastly overestimate mortality from and contagiousness of the virus. Providing participants with information regarding these statistics substantially lowers participants' expectations about the severity of the crisis and participants' worries regarding the aggregate economy and their personal economic situation. These results suggest that factual public education about the virus will help to contain spreading economic anxiety and improve economic sentiment.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Filho, Tarcisio M Rocha</author><author>Santos, Fabiana S.

In January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Interest (PHEI). Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the impact of a COVID-19 epidemic in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: We used a generalized SEIR (Susceptibles, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model, with additional Hospitalized variables (SEIHR model) and age-stratified structure to analyze the expected time evolution during the onset of the epidemic in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo. The model allows to determine the evolution of the number of cases, the number of patients admitted to hospitals and deaths caused by COVID-19. In order to investigate the sensibility of our results with respect to parameter estimation errors we performed Monte Carlo analysis with 100 000 simulations by sampling parameter values from an uniform distribution in the confidence interval. Results: We estimate 1 368 (IQR: 880, 2 407) cases, 301 (22%) in older people (more than 60 years), 81 (50, 143) hospitalizations, and 14 (9, 26) deaths in the first 30 days, and 38 583 (IQR: 16 698, 113, 163) cases, 8 427 (21.8%) in older people (more than 60 years), 2181 (914, 6392) hospitalizations, and 397(166, 1205) deaths in the first 60 days. Limitations: We supposed a constant transmission probability Pc among different age-groups, and that every severe and critic case will be hospitalized, as well as that the detection capacity in all the primary healthcare services does not change during the outbreak. Conclusion: Supposing the reported parameters in the literature apply in the city of Sao Paulo, our study shows that it is expected that the impact of a COVID-19 outbreak will be important, requiring special planning from the authorities. This is the first study for a major metropolitan center in the south hemisphere, and we believe it can provide policymakers with a prognosis of the burden of the pandemic not only in Brazil, but also in other tropical zones, allowing to estimate total cases, hospitalization, and deaths, in support to the management of the public health emergence caused by COVID-19.

As of February 7, 2020, 44 strains of the virus have been sequenced and uploaded to NCBI's GenBank, providing insight into the virus's evolutionary history and pathogenesis. Here, we present the WashU Virus Genome Browser, a web-based portal for viewing virus genomic data. The browser is home to 16 complete 2019-nCoV genome sequences, together with hundreds of related viral sequences including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Ebola virus. In addition, the browser features unique customizability, supporting user-provided upload of novel viral sequences in various formats. Sequences can be viewed in both a track-based representation as well as a phylogenetic tree-based view, allowing the user to easily compare sequence features across multiple strains. The WashU Virus Genome Browser inherited many features and track types from the WashU Epigenome Browser, and additionally incorporated a new type of SNV track to address the specific needs of viral research.

Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC) simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fong, Simon James</author><author>Li, Gloria</author><author>Dey, Nilanjan</author><author>Crespo, Rubén González</author><author>Herrera-Viedma, Enrique</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Finding an Accurate Early Forecasting Model from Small Dataset: A Case of 2019-nCoV Novel Coronavirus Outbreak</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence</full-title></periodical><pages>1</pages><volume>InPress</volume><issue>InPress</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Universidad Internacional de La Rioja</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.9781/ijimai.2020.02.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10776</url><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.9781/ijimai.2020.02.002</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Epidemic is a rapid and wide spread of infectious disease threatening many lives and economy damages. It is important to fore-tell the epidemic lifetime so to decide on timely and remedic actions. These measures include closing borders, schools, suspending community services and commuters. Resuming such curfews depends on the momentum of the outbreak and its rate of decay. Being able to accurately forecast the fate of an epidemic is an extremely important but difficult task. Due to limited knowledge of the novel disease, the high uncertainty involved and the complex societal-political factors that influence the widespread of the new virus, any forecast is anything but reliable. Another factor is the insufficient amount of available data. Data samples are often scarce when an epidemic just started. With only few training samples on hand, finding a forecasting model which offers forecast at the best efforts is a big challenge in machine learning. In the past, three popular methods have been proposed, they include 1) augmenting the existing little data, 2) using a panel selection to pick the best forecasting model from several models, and 3) fine-tuning the parameters of an individual forecastingmodel for the highest possible accuracy. In this paper, a methodology that embraces these three virtues of data mining from a small dataset is proposed...</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fong, Simon James</author><author>Li, Gloria</author><author>Dey, Nilanjan</author><author>Gonzalez-Crespo, Rubén</author><author>Herrera-Viedma, Enrique</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Finding an Accurate Early Forecasting Model from Small Dataset: A Case of 2019-nCoV Novel Coronavirus Outbreak</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence</full-title></periodical><pages>1</pages><volume>InPress</volume><issue>InPress</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Universidad Internacional de La Rioja</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.9781/ijimai.2020.02.002</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fu, Haiyan</author><author>Li, Hongjuan</author><author>Tang, Xiaoqing</author><author>Li, Xiang</author><author>Shen, Jie</author><author>Zhou, Yujun</author><author>Xu, Bing</author><author>Luo, Yu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis on the Clinical Characteristics of 36 Cases of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia in Kunming</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.28.20029173</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.28.20029173</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming City, and to study the correlation between nutritional status and immune function. Methods: Clinical data of 36 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia in isolation area of Kunming Third People's Hospital from January 31 to February 15, 2020 were collected, and the basic situation, clinical characteristics, laboratory examination and CT imaging characteristics were analyzed. Serum albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PAB), hypersensitive c-reactive protein (hs-crp), CD3T cells, CD4T cells, CD8T cells and normal control group were analyzed. A simple linear regression analysis of the relationship between proalbumin and T cell subpopulation counts in the blood of patients. Results: (1) The patients with new coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming were mainly of common type. (2) 50% of the patients' first symptoms were fever and cough; (3) The total number of white blood cells in peripheral blood was normal or decreased in 23 cases (79%), and the lymphocyte count decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), without anemia. Hypersensitive c-reactive protein increased in 19 (52.78%) cases, and procalcitonin increased in 1 case. Albumin decreased in 5 cases (13.89%), proalbumin decreased in 15 cases (41.67%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), alanine transaminase increased slightly in 4 cases (11.11%), total bilirubin increased slightly in 11 cases (30.56%), and renal function and blood coagulation were normal. Absolute value of CD3+T cells is with a decrease in 21 cases (58.3%), CD4+T in 28 cases (77.8%), CD8+T in 17 cases (47.2%), and CD4+/ CD8+ inverse in 6 cases (16.7%). (4) The prealbumin, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells in the new coronavirus pneumonia group were significantly lower than those in the normal control group, and the hypersensitive c-reactive protein was higher than that in the normal control group. (5) The levels of PAB in the serum of the patients were linearly correlated with hs-crp, CD3 T cells, CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells, and the correlation coefficients were -0.474, 0.558, 0.467 and 0.613, respectively, showing statistical differences. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming are different from those in Wuhan. The changes of serum proalbumin and T cell subsets are relatively obvious. Changes in serum proalbumin may contribute to the early warning of novel coronavirus pneumonia. The nutritional status of patients with common and mild pneumonia should be considered.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been widely pandemic all over the world. The aim of this study was to analyze the influence factors of death risk among 200 COVID-19 patients. Methods. Two hundred patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited. Demographic data and clinical characteristics were collected from electronic medical records. Biochemical indexes on admission were measured and patient's prognosis was tracked. The association of demographic data, clinical characteristics and biochemical indexes with death risk was analyzed. Results. Of 200 COVID-19 patients, 163 (81.5%) had at least one of comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, hepatic disease, cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease and others. Among all patients, critical cases, defined as oxygenation index lower than 200, accounted for 26.2%. Severe cases, oxygenation index from 200 to 300, were 29.7%. Besides, common cases, oxygenation index higher than 300, accounted for 44.1%. At the end of follow-up, 34 (17%) were died on mean 10.9 day after hospitalization. Stratified analysis revealed that older ages, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities elevated death risk of COVID-19 patients. On admission, 85.5% COVID-19 patients were with at least one of extrapulmonary organ injuries. Univariable logistic regression showed that ALT and TBIL, two indexes of hepatic injury, AST, myoglobin and LDH, AST/ALT ratio, several markers of myocardial injury, creatinine, urea nitrogen and uric acid, three indexes of renal injury, were positively associated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission were positively correlated with death risk of COVID-19 patients. Conclusion. Older age, lower oxygenation index and comorbidities on admission elevate death risk of COVID-19 patients. AST/ALT ratio, urea nitrogen, TBIL and LDH on admission may be potential prognostic indicators. Early hospitalization is of great significance to prevent multiple organ damage and improve the survival of COVID-19 patients.

### Clinical Trial

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been widely pandemic all over the world. After the first patient was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, this infecting disease broke out quickly, spread around all over the world and was persistently evolving so far. Until 6 March, 2020, 80581 cases were confirmed to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 3016 cases died from SARS-CoV-2 infection in China. In other countries, total 17024 COVID-19 patients were confirmed and 343 patients died after being infected with SARS-CoV-2. This novel disease is a neo-type respiratory contagious disease that has high infectivity and mortality as well as heavy damage on public health. Clinical trial has been registered before this research. However, it needs a long time to finish all the process, the clinical trial ID is not obtained temporarily and still transacted.

It very urgent to forecast the future course of the outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the potential total number of confirmed cases in mainland China by applying Boltzmann-function based regression analyses. We found that the cumulative number of confirmed cases from Jan 21 to Feb 14, 2020 for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and other provinces were all well fitted with the Boltzmann function (R2 being close to 0.999). The potential total number of confirmed cases in the above geographic regions were estimated at 95% confidence interval (CI) as 79589 (71576, 93855), 64817 (58223, 77895), 46562 (40812, 57678) and 13956 (12748, 16092), respectively. Notably, our results suggest that the number of daily new confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in mainland China (including Hubei Province) will become minimal between Feb 28 and Mar 10, 2020, with 95% CI. In addition, we found that the data of cumulative confirmed cases of 2003 SARS-CoV in China and Worldwide were also well fitted to the Boltzmann function. To our knowledge this is the first study revealing that the Boltzmann function is suitable to simulate epidemics. The estimated potential total number of confirmed cases and key dates for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak may provide certain guidance for governments, organizations and citizens to optimize preparedness and response efforts. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work is support by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31972918 and 31770830 to XF). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Whereas different estimates for the incubation period distribution and the serial interval distribution have been reported, estimates of the generation interval for COVID-19 have not been provided. Methods: We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates we obtained the proportions pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers. Results: The mean generation interval was 5.20 (95%CI 3.78-6.78) days for Singapore and 3.95 (95%CI 3.01-4.91) days for Tianjin, China when relying on a previously reported incubation period with mean 5.2 and SD 2.8 days. The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95%CI 32-67%) for Singapore and 62% (95%CI 50-76%) for Tianjin, China. Estimates of the reproduction number based on the generation interval distribution were slightly higher than those based on the serial interval distribution. Conclusions: Estimating generation and serial interval distributions from outbreak data requires careful investigation of the underlying transmission network. Detailed contact tracing information is essential for correctly estimating these quantities.

The study initially enrolled 102 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia from a continuous sample. After screening out the ineligible cases, 54 patients were analyzed in this study. Results found that patients with higher NT-proBNP (above 88.64 pg/mL) level had more risks of in-hospital death. After adjusting for potential cofounders in separate modes, NT-proBNP presented as an independent risk factor of in-hospital death in patients with severe COVID-19.

This study explored the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Jingmen. Methods: All confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the First People′s Hospital of Jingmen are included from January 12 to February 14,2020. Cases were analyzed for epidemiological data and were confirmed by real-time PCR. Findings: Of the 213 cases (108 men and 105 women) , 88 (41%) had exposure to Wuhan. The median age was 48 years ( range,2-88 years;IQR,35-58.5). Thirty-three severe patients with a median age of 66 years(range,33-82 years,IQR, 57-76) were treated in intensive care units; out of these patients, 66.7 %(22) were men and 19 (57.5%) had chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, stroke, and renal insufficiency. Under the controlled measures, the number of new patients gradually decreased and nearly disappeared after 20 days. Interpretation: All people are susceptible to the COVID-19, but older males and those with comorbid conditions are more likely to have severe symptoms. Even though COVID-19 is highly contagious, control measures have proven to be very effective.

This study analyzes the geo temporal effects on disease severity for the 1,688 Chinese healthcare workers infected with COVID 19. Method Using the descriptive results recently reported by the Chinese CDC, we compare the percentage of infected healthcare workers in severe conditions over time and across three areas in China, and the fatality rate of infected healthcare workers with all the infected individuals in China aged 22 to 59 years. Results Among the infected Chinese healthcare workers whose symptoms onset appeared during the same ten day period, the percentage of those in severe conditions decreased statistical significantly from 19.7% (Jan 11 to 20) to 14.4% (Jan 21 to 31) to 8.7% (Feb 1 to 11). Across the country, there was also a significant difference in the disease severity among patients symptoms onset during the same period, with Wuhan being the most severe (17%), followed by Hubei Province (10.4%), and the rest of China (7.0%). The case fatality rate for the 1,688 infected Chinese healthcare workers was significantly lower than that for the 29,798 infected patients aged 20 to 59 years 0.3% (5/1,688) vs. 0.65% (193/29,798), respectively. Conclusion The disease severity improved considerably over a short period of time in China. The more severe conditions in Wuhan compared to the rest of the country may be attributable to the draconian lockdown. The clinical outcomes of infected Chinese healthcare workers may represent a more accurate estimation of the severity of COVID 19 for those who have access to quality healthcare.

Methods A descriptive analysis was utilized to explore the epidemiological characteristics. A spatial mapping description was conducted to explore the geographic characteristics. Findings China has reported 5981 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV infections, including 132 fatal cases until 28 January. The fatality rate was 2.21%. And there were still 9239 probable cases. From 23 January, the growth rate has been increased with a peak on 27 January. Of the neighboring provinces of Hubei, Chongqing reported the most cases until 24 January. Henan reported the most cases from 25 January to 27 January. Hunan reported the most cases on 28 January. Of the other provinces, Guangdong and Zhejiang had more confirmed cases with a higher growth rate . Interpretation The epidemic is in the stage of mass morbidity and rigorous screening for probable cases. Although the number of the cases have still increased in China, a series of prevention and control measures have been taken throughout China.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, Z C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Efficient management of novel coronavirus pneumonia by efficient prevention and control in scientific manner]</title><secondary-title>Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi</full-title></periodical><pages>E001</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>0</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>Neumonia</keyword><keyword>Novel coronavirus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>1001-0939 (Print)1001-0939</isbn><accession-num>32023684</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0001</electronic-resource-num><notes>Gao, Z C

We developed a data-driven drug repositioning framework, which applies both machine learning and statistical analysis approaches to systematically integrate and mine large-scale knowledge graph, literature and transcriptome data to discover the potential drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The retrospective study using the past SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV data demonstrated that our machine learning based method can successfully predict effective drug candidates against a specific coronavirus. Our in silico screening followed by wet-lab validation indicated that a poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, CVL218, currently in Phase I clinical trial, may be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Our in vitro assays revealed that CVL218 can exhibit effective inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication without obvious cytopathic effect. In addition, we showed that CVL218 is able to suppress the CpG-induced IL-6 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, suggesting that it may also have anti-inflammatory effect that is highly relevant to the prevention immunopathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic evaluation in rats and monkeys showed a high concentration of CVL218 in lung and observed no apparent signs of toxicity, indicating the appealing potential of this drug for the treatment of the pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, molecular docking simulation suggested that CVL218 may bind to the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2, providing a possible model to explain its antiviral action. We also proposed several possible mechanisms to explain the antiviral activities of PARP1 inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, based on the data present in this study and previous evidences reported in the literature. In summary, the PARP1 inhibitor CVL218 discovered by our data-driven drug repositioning framework can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of COVID-19.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gilbert, Marius</author><author>Pullano, Giulia</author><author>Pinotti, Francesco</author><author>Valdano, Eugenio</author><author>Poletto, Chiara</author><author>Boelle, Pierre-Yves</author><author>D'Ortenzio, Eric</author><author>Yazdanpanah, Yazdan</author><author>Eholie, Serge Paul</author><author>Altmann, Mathias</author><author>Gutierrez, Bernardo</author><author>Kraemer, Moritz U G</author><author>Colizza, Vittoria</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against introductions of 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.05.20020792</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.05.20020792</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/07/2020.02.05.20020792.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic has spread to 23 countries from China. Local cycles of transmission already occurred in 7 countries following case importation. No African country has reported cases yet. The management and control of 2019-nCoV introductions heavily relies on the public health capacity of a country. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of 2019-nCoV. We used data on air travel volumes departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of introduction per country. We determined the countries capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulation Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, with the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing the most to their risk. Findings: Countries at the highest importation risk (Egypt, Algeria, Republic of South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. Three clusters of countries are identified that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Beijing, respectively. Interpretation: Several countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with 2019-nCoV importations. Resources and intensified surveillance and capacity capacity should be urgently prioritized towards countries at moderate risk that may be ill-prepared to face the importation and to limit onward transmission.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding Statement This study was partially supported by the ANR project DATAREDUX (ANR-19-CE46-0008-03) to VC; the EU grant MOOD (H2020-874850) to MG, CP, MK, PYB, VC.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Italy has now become the most hit country outside of Asia: on March 16, 2020, the Italian Civil Protection documented a total of 27980 confirmed cases and 2158 deaths of people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In the context of an emerging infectious disease outbreak, it is of paramount importance to predict the trend of the epidemic in order to plan an effective control strategy and to determine its impact. This paper proposes a new epidemic model that discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed is important because non-diagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the infection than diagnosed ones, since the latter are typically isolated, and can explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the seriousness of the epidemic phenomenon. Being able to predict the amount of patients that will develop life-threatening symptoms is important since the disease frequently requires hospitalisation (and even Intensive Care Unit admission) and challenges the healthcare system capacity. We show how the basic reproduction number can be redefined in the new framework, thus capturing the potential for epidemic containment. Simulation results are compared with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, to show the validity of the model and compare different possible predicted scenarios depending on the adopted countermeasures.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giorgio, Salvatore Di</author><author>Martignano, Filippo</author><author>Torcia, Maria Gabriella</author><author>Mattiuz, Giorgio</author><author>Conticello, Silvestro G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evidence for RNA editing in the transcriptome of 2019 Novel Coronavirus</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.02.973255</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.02.973255</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The 2019-nCoV outbreak has become a global health risk. Editing by host deaminases is an innate restriction process to counter viruses, and it is not yet known whether it operates against coronaviruses. Here we analyze RNA sequences from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids derived from two Wuhan patients. We identify nucleotide changes that may be signatures of RNA editing: Adenosine-to-Inosine changes from ADAR deaminases and Cytosine-to-Uracil changes from APOBEC ones. A mutational analysis of genomes from different strains of human-hosted Coronaviridae reveals patterns similar to the RNA editing pattern observed in the 2019-nCoV transcriptomes. Our results suggest that both APOBECs and ADARs are involved in Coronavirus genome editing, a process that may shape the fate of both virus and patient.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giovanetti, Marta</author><author>Benvenuto, Domenico</author><author>Angeletti, Silvia</author><author>Ciccozzi, Massimo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The first two cases of 2019‐nCoV in Italy: where they come from?</title><secondary-title>Journal of Medical Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Medical Virology</full-title></periodical><pages>jmv.25699</pages><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>Epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Infection</keyword><keyword>Macromolecular design &lt; Engineering and Technology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0146-6615</isbn><accession-num>32022275</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jmv.25699</electronic-resource-num><notes>1096-9071

In this short report, phylogenetic reconstruction was used to better understand the transmission dynamic of the virus from its first introduction in China focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a couple of Chinese tourists arrived in Italy on 23(rd) January 2020 and labeled as Coronavirus Italian cases. A Maximum Clade Credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019-nCoV plus 2 closely related bat strains (SARS-like CoV) available in GeneBank. Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis was implemented in BEAST 1.10.4. The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that the 2019-2020 nCoV firstly introduced in Wuhan on the 25th November 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide, including Europe and Italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19th January 2020, the same that the Chinese tourists arrived in Italy. Strains isolated outside China were intermixed with strains isolated in China as evidence of likely imported cases in Rome, Italy and Europe, as well. In conclusion, this report suggests that further spread of 2019-nCoV epidemic was supported by human mobility and that quarantine of suspected or diagnosed cases is useful to prevent further transmission. Viral genome phylogenetic analysis represents a useful tool for evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action. This article is protected by copyright.

More than 4000 mortalities have occurred worldwide till the writing of this article and this number is increasing every passing hour. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it as a global public health emergency. The multiple sequence alignment data correlated with already published reports on SARS-CoV-2 indicated that it is closely related to Bat-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome like coronavirus (Bat CoV SARS-like) and well-studied Human SARS. In this study, we have exploited the complementary approach to examine the intrinsically disordered regions in proteome of SARS-CoV-2 using Bat SARS-like and Human SARS CoVs as comparative models. According to our findings, SARS-CoV-2 proteome contains a significant amount of ordered proteins except Nucleocapsid, Nsp8, and ORF6. Further, cleavage sites in replicase 1ab polyprotein are found to be highly disordered. We have extensively investigated the dark proteome in SARS-CoV-2 which will have implications for the structured and unstructured biology of SARS or SARS-like coronaviruses.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Giuliani, Diego</author><author>Dickson, Maria Michela</author><author>Espa, Giuseppe</author><author>Santi, Flavio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modelling and predicting the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection in NUTS-3 Italian regions</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06664</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>This paper represents a frst attempt to model and predict the spatio-temporal distribution of Coronavirus (COVID-19) infections at NUTS-3 regional level in Italy.

With almost 65,000 infected, a worldwide death toll of at least 1370 (as of 14 February 2020), and with the potential to affect up to two-thirds of the world population, COVID-19 is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be a global health emergency. The speed of spread and infectivity of COVID-19 (also known as Wuhan-2019-nCoV) are dramatically exceeding those of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In fact, since September 2012, the WHO has been notified of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, whereas the 2002–2003 epidemic of SARS affected 26 countries and resulted in more than 8000 cases. Therefore, although SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are all the result of coronaviral infections, the causes of the coronaviruses differ dramatically in their transmissibility. It is likely that these differences in infectivity of coronaviruses can be attributed to the differences in the rigidity of their shells which can be evaluated using computational tools for predicting intrinsic disorder predisposition of the corresponding viral proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gong, Jing</author><author>Dong, Hui</author><author>Xia, Song Qing</author><author>Huang, Yi Zhao</author><author>Wang, Dingkun</author><author>Zhao, Yan</author><author>Liu, Wenhua</author><author>Tu, Shenghao</author><author>Zhang, Mingmin</author><author>Wang, Qi</author><author>Lu, Fuer</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Correlation Analysis Between Disease Severity and Inflammation-related Parameters in Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.25.20025643</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.25.20025643</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Aim: The new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreaking at the end of 2019 is highly contagious. Crude mortality rate reached 49% in critical patients. Inflammation matters on disease progression. This study analyzed blood inflammation indicators among mild, severe and critical patients, helping to identify severe or critical patients early. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 100 patients were included and divided to mild, severe or critical groups. Correlation of peripheral blood inflammation-related indicators with disease criticality was analyzed. Cut-off values for critically ill patients were speculated through the ROC curve. Results：Significantly, disease severity were associated with age (R=-0.564, P&lt;0.001), interleukin-2 receptor (IL2R) (R=-0.534, P&lt;0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (R=-0.535, P&lt;0.001), interleukin-8 (IL-8) (R=-0.308, P&lt;0.001), interleukin-10 (IL-10) (R=-0.422, P&lt;0.001), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (R=-0.322, P&lt;0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (R=-0.604, P&lt;0.001), ferroprotein (R=-0.508, P&lt;0.001), procalcitonin (R=-0.650, P&lt;0.001), white cell counts (WBC) (R=-0.54, P&lt;0.001), lymphocyte counts (LC) (R=-0.56, P&lt;0.001), neutrophil count (NC) (R=-0.585, P&lt;0.001) and eosinophil counts (EC) (R=-0.299, P=0.01). Conclusion：With following parameters such as age &gt;67.5 years, IL2R &gt;793.5U/mL, CRP &gt;30.7ng/mL, ferroprotein &gt;2252μg/L, WBC&gt;9.5*10^9/L or NC &gt;7.305*10^9/L, the progress of COVID-19 to critical stage should be closely observed and possibly prevented. Inflammation is closely related to severity of COVID-19, and IL-6, TNFα and IL-8 might be promising therapeutic targets.

Here, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the official classification of viruses and taxa naming (taxonomy) of the Coronaviridae family, assessed the novelty of the human pathogen tentatively named 2019-nCoV. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To facilitate communication, the CSG further proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/Isolate/Host/Date/Location. The spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined. The independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying the entire (virus) species to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This research will improve our understanding of virus-host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gorse, Geoffrey J.</author><author>Donovan, Mary M.</author><author>Patel, Gira B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antibodies to Coronaviruses Are Higher in Older Compared with Younger Adults and Binding Antibodies Are More Sensitive than Neutralizing Antibodies in Identifying Coronavirus‐Associated Illnesses</title><secondary-title>Journal of Medical Virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Medical Virology</full-title></periodical><pages>jmv.25715</pages><keywords><keyword>antibody</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>immunity</keyword><keyword>neutralization</keyword><keyword>respiratory illness</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jmv.25715</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25715</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gostic, Katelyn</author><author>Gomez, Ana C R</author><author>Mummah, Riley O</author><author>Kucharski, Adam J</author><author>Lloyd-Smith, James O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimated effectiveness of traveller screening to prevent international spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.28.20019224</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.28.20019224</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/01/30/2020.01.28.20019224.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Traveller screening is being used to limit further global spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) following its recent emergence. Here, we analyze the expected impact of different travel screening programs given remaining uncertainty around the values of key nCoV life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss around half of infected travellers. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. These findings emphasize the need for measures to track travellers who become ill after being missed by a travel screening program. We make our model available for interactive use so stakeholders can explore scenarios of interest using the most up-to-date information. We hope these findings contribute to evidence-based policy to combat the spread of nCoV, and to prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementKG was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship in the program for understanding dynamic &amp;amp; multiscale systems from the James S.

Materials and Methods: Multiple international datasets, including from Chinese disease-infected areas were included. We present a system that utilizes robust 2D and 3D deep learning models, modifying and adapting existing AI models and combining them with clinical understanding. We conducted multiple retrospective experiments to analyze the performance of the system in the detection of suspected COVID-19 thoracic CT features and to evaluate evolution of the disease in each patient over time using a 3D volume review, generating a Corona score. The study includes a testing set of 157 international patients (China and U.S). Results: Classification results for Coronavirus vs Non-coronavirus cases per thoracic CT studies were 0.996 AUC (95%CI: 0.989-1.00) ; on datasets of Chinese control and infected patients. Possible working point: 98.2% sensitivity, 92.2% specificity. For time analysis of Coronavirus patients, the system output enables quantitative measurements for smaller opacities (volume, diameter) and visualization of the larger opacities in a slice-based heat map or a 3D volume display. Our suggested Corona score measures the progression of disease over time. Conclusion: This initial study, which is currently being expanded to a larger population, demonstrated that rapidly developed AI-based image analysis can achieve high accuracy in detection of Coronavirus as well as quantification and tracking of disease burden.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gralinski, Lisa E</author><author>Menachery, Vineet D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Return of the Coronavirus: 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>Viruses</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Viruses</full-title></periodical><pages>135</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>MERS-CoV</keyword><keyword>SARS-CoV</keyword><keyword>Virology</keyword><keyword>Wuhan</keyword><keyword>Wuhan pneumonia</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>emerging viruses</keyword><keyword>infection</keyword><keyword>mers</keyword><keyword>novel CoV</keyword><keyword>receptor</keyword><keyword>respiratory-syndrome coronavirus</keyword><keyword>rhesus</keyword><keyword>sars</keyword><keyword>tract</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/v12020135</electronic-resource-num><notes>ISI Document Delivery No.: KH2ZS

We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) resource to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to 2019-nCoV, and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in 2019-nCoV that have high homology to SARS virus. Parallel bionformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for 2019-nCoV.

Without any vaccination or medicine, the means of controlling it are limited to quarantine and social distancing. Here we study the spatio-temporal propagation of the COVID-19 virus in China and compare it to other global locations. Our results suggest that the disease propagation is highly related to population migration from Hubei resembling a L\'{e}vy flight which is characteristic of human mobility. Our results also suggest that the disease spread in a city in China is characterized by two-stages process. At early times, at order of few days, the infection rate in the city is almost constant probably due to the lack of means to detect infected individuals before infection signs are observed and at later times it decays approximately exponentially due to quarantines. These two stages can explain the significant differences between the propagation in China and in other world-wide locations. While most Chinese cities control the disease which resulted in the decaying stage, in other world-wide countries the situation is still becoming worse probably due to less control.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Group of Interventional Respiratory Medicine, Chinese Thoracic Society</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Expert consensus for bronchoscopy during the epidemic of 2019 Novel Coronavirus infection (Trial version)</title><secondary-title>Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>E006-E006</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>2019 Novel Coronavirus infection</keyword><keyword>Bronchoscopy</keyword><keyword>Indications</keyword><keyword>Prevention and protection</keyword><keyword>Sampling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>China</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0006</electronic-resource-num><language>chi</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32033514</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Infection with 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets, airborne transmission and direct contact. However, conducting bronchoscopy on patients with 2019-nCoV is a high-risk procedure in which health care workers are directly exposed to the virus, and the protection and operation procedures need to be strictly regulated. According to the characteristics of bronchoscopy, it is necessary to formulate the procedure, requirements and precautions when conducting bronchoscopy in the current epidemic situation. Relevant standards for preventing from infections should be strictly implemented in the operation of bronchoscopy. It needs to emphasize that bronchoscopy should not be used as a routine means for the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection sampling. The indications for bronchoscopy for other diseases should be strictly mastered, and it is suggested that bronchoscopy should be postponed for those patients who is not in urgent situation.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gu, Haogao</author><author>Chu, Daniel K W</author><author>Peiris, Joseph Sriyal Malik</author><author>Poon, Leo L M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multivariate Analyses of Codon Usage in 2019 Novel Coronavirus on the Genomic Landscape of Betacoronavirus</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.15.950568</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.15.950568</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Gu et al. - 2020 - Multivariate Analyses of Codon Usage in 2019 Novel Coronavirus on the Genomic Landscape of Betacoronavirus.pdf</url><url>internal-pdf://Gu et al. - 2020 - Multivariate Analyses of Codon Usage in 2019 Novel Coronavirus on the Genomic Landscape of Betacoronavirus(2).pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is raising global concern as it continues to spread nationally and internationally since its first report in December 2019 in China. The SARS-CoV-2 was identified to be in the Betacoronavirus genera which also includes the severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (MERSr-CoV). Codon usage of the viral genes might be subjected to selection pressure from different hosts or environments. Previous studies on codon usage of influenza A viruses could help to identify viral host origins and evolutionary trends, however similar studies on coronaviruses are lacking. In this study, global correspondence analysis (CA), within-group correspondence analysis (WCA) and between-group correspondence analysis (BCA) were performed among different genes in coronavirus viral sequences. The amino acid usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 was generally found similar to bat and human SARSr-CoVs. However, we found greater synonymous codon usage distance between SARS-CoV-2 and its phylogenetic relatives on spike and membrane genes, suggesting these two genes of SARS-CoV-2 are subjected to different evolutionary pressures.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guan, Wei-jie</author><author>Liang, Wen-hua</author><author>Zhao, Yi</author><author>Liang, Heng-rui</author><author>Chen, Zi-sheng</author><author>Li, Yi-min</author><author>Liu, Xiao-qing</author><author>Chen, Ru-chong</author><author>Tang, Chun-li</author><author>Wang, Tao</author><author>Ou, Chun-quan</author><author>Li, Li</author><author>Chen, Ping-yan</author><author>Sang, Ling</author><author>Wang, Wei</author><author>Li, Jian-fu</author><author>Li, Cai-chen</author><author>Ou, Li-min</author><author>Cheng, Bo</author><author>Xiong, Shan</author><author>Ni, Zheng-yi</author><author>Hu, Yu</author><author>Xiang, Jie</author><author>Liu, Lei</author><author>Shan, Hong</author><author>Lei, Chun-liang</author><author>Peng, Yi-xiang</author><author>Wei, Li</author><author>Liu, Yong</author><author>Hu, Ya-hua</author><author>Peng, Peng</author><author>Wang, Jian-ming</author><author>Liu, Ji-yang</author><author>Chen, Zhong</author><author>Li, Gang</author><author>Zheng, Zhi-jian</author><author>Qiu, Shao-qin</author><author>Luo, Jie</author><author>Ye, Chang-jiang</author><author>Zhu, Shao-yong</author><author>Cheng, Lin-ling</author><author>Ye, Feng</author><author>Li, Shi-yue</author><author>Zheng, Jin-ping</author><author>Zhang, Nuo-fu</author><author>Zhong, Nan-shan</author><author>He, Jian-xing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comorbidity and its impact on 1,590 patients with COVID-19 in China: A Nationwide Analysis</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.25.20027664</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.25.20027664</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Objective: To evaluate the spectrum of comorbidities and its impact on the clinical outcome in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Design: Retrospective case studies Setting: 575 hospitals in 31 province/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across China Participants: 1,590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients. Data were collected from November 21st, 2019 to January 31st, 2020. Main outcomes and measures: Epidemiological and clinical variables (in particular, comorbidities) were extracted from medical charts. The disease severity was categorized based on the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. The primary endpoint was the composite endpoints, which consisted of the admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or invasive ventilation, or death. The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared among patients with COVID-19 according to the presence and number of comorbidities. Results: Of the 1,590 cases, the mean age was 48.9 years. 686 patients (42.7%) were females. 647 (40.7%) patients were managed inside Hubei province, and 1,334 (83.9%) patients had a contact history of Wuhan city. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. 269 (16.9%), 59 (3.7%), 30 (1.9%), 130 (8.2%), 28 (1.8%), 24 (1.5%), 21 (1.3%), 18 (1.1%) and 3 (0.2%) patients reported having hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, hepatitis B infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney diseases, malignancy and immunodeficiency, respectively. 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. Patients with two or more comorbidities had significantly escalated risks of reaching to the composite endpoint compared with those who had a single comorbidity, and even more so as compared with those without (all P&lt;0.05). After adjusting for age and smoking status, patients with COPD (HR 2.681, 95%CI 1.424-5.048), diabetes (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.03-2.45), hypertension (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.07-2.32) and malignancy (HR 3.50, 95%CI 1.60-7.64) were more likely to reach to the composite endpoints than those without. As compared with patients without comorbidity, the HR (95%CI) was 1.79 (95%CI 1.16-2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (95%CI 1.61-4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities. Conclusion: Comorbidities are present in around one fourth of patients with COVID-19 in China, and predispose to poorer clinical outcomes.

We sought to delineate the clinical characteristics of these cases. Methods: We extracted the data on 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV ARD from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces/provincial municipalities through January 29th, 2020. Results: The median age was 47.0 years, and 41.90% were females. Only 1.18% of patients had a direct contact with wildlife, whereas 31.30% had been to Wuhan and 71.80% had contacted with people from Wuhan. Fever (87.9%) and cough (67.7%) were the most common symptoms. Diarrhea is uncommon. The median incubation period was 3.0 days (range, 0 to 24.0 days). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (50.00%). Significantly more severe cases were diagnosed by symptoms plus reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction without abnormal radiological findings than non-severe cases (23.87% vs. 5.20%, P&amp;amp;lt;0.001). Lymphopenia was observed in 82.1% of patients. 55 patients (5.00%) were admitted to intensive care unit and 15 (1.36%) succumbed. Severe pneumonia was independently associated with either the admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death in multivariate competing-risk model (sub-distribution hazards ratio, 9.80; 95% confidence interval, 4.06 to 23.67). Conclusions: The 2019-nCoV epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Normal radiologic findings are present among some patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The disease severity (including oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count and chest X-ray/CT manifestations) predict poor clinical outcomes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNAFunding StatementSupported by Ministry of Science and Technology, National Health Commission, National Natural Science Foundation, Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

In this report, we introduced the VHP (Virus Host Prediction) to predict the potential hosts of viruses using deep learning algorithm. Our prediction suggests that 2019-nCoV has close infectivity with other human coronaviruses, especially the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Bat SARS-like Coronaviruses and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Based on our prediction, compared to the Coronaviruses infecting other vertebrates, bat coronaviruses are assigned with more similar infectivity patterns with 2019-nCoVs. Furthermore, by comparing the infectivity patterns of all viruses hosted on vertebrates, we found mink viruses show a closer infectivity pattern to 2019-nCov. These consequences of infectivity pattern analysis illustrate that bat and mink may be two candidate reservoirs of 2019-nCov.These results warn us to beware of 2019-nCoV and guide us to further explore the properties and reservoir of it.One Sentence Summary It is of great value to identify whether a newly discovered virus has the risk of infecting human. Guo et al. proposed a virus host prediction method based on deep learning to detect what kind of host a virus can infect with DNA sequence as input. Applied to the Wuhan 2019 Novel Coronavirus, our prediction demonstrated that several vertebrate-infectious coronaviruses have strong potential to infect human. This method will be helpful in future viral analysis and early prevention and control of viral pathogens.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guo, Yan-Rong</author><author>Cao, Qing-Dong</author><author>Hong, Zhong-Si</author><author>Tan, Yuan-Yang</author><author>Chen, Shou-Deng</author><author>Jin, Hong-Jun</author><author>Tan, Kai-Sen</author><author>Wang, De-Yun</author><author>Yan, Yan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The origin, transmission and clinical therapies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak – an update on the status</title><secondary-title>Military Medical Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Military Medical Research</full-title></periodical><pages>11</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Mil Med Res</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s40779-020-00240-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://mmrjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40779-020-00240-0</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;not added;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gurwitz, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Angiotensin receptor blockers as tentative SARS‐CoV‐2 therapeutics</title><secondary-title>Drug Development Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Drug Development Research</full-title></periodical><pages>ddr.21656</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Drug Dev Res</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ddr.21656</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ddr.21656</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Habibzadeh, P</author><author>Stoneman, E K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Novel Coronavirus: A Bird's Eye View</title><secondary-title>Int J Occup Environ Med</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Int J Occup Environ Med</full-title></periodical><pages>65-71</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>2</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Emerging viruses</keyword><keyword>Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Novel coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Outbreak</keyword><keyword>SARS coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Wuhan</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>2008-6520</isbn><accession-num>32020915</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.15171/ijoem.2020.1921</electronic-resource-num><notes>2008-6814

The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV through human passenger air flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated passengers' end destination data for the period of 1–31 January 2020 from FLIRT, an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of 2019-nCoV transmission based on the number of travellers to destination countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on the risk index in four quantiles (4 &lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; quantile being the highest risk and 1 &lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were destined for 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories across the world. The risk index of 2019-nCoV among the countries had a very high correlation with the WHO-reported confirmed cases (0.97). According to our risk score classification, of the countries that reported at least one Coronavirus-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) case as of 5 February 2020, 24 countries were in the 4 &lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; quantile of the risk index, two in the 3 &lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; quantile, one in the 2 &lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; quantile and none in the 1 &lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; quantile. Outside China, countries with a higher risk of 2019-nCoV transmission are Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the USA, all of which reported at least one case. In pan-Europe, UK, France, Russia, Germany and Italy; in North America, USA and Canada; in Oceania, Australia had high risk, all of them reported at least one case. In Africa and South America, the risk of transmission is very low with Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil showing a similar risk of transmission compared to the risk of any of the countries where at least one case is detected. The risk of transmission on 31 January 2020 was very high in neighbouring Asian countries, followed by Europe (UK, France, Russia and Germany), Oceania (Australia) and North America (USA and Canada). Increased public health response including early case recognition, isolation of identified case, contract tracing and targeted airport screening, public awareness and vigilance of health workers will help mitigate the force of further spread to naïve countries. &lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Han, Chuanliang</author><author>Liu, Yimeng</author><author>Yang, Saini</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intrinsic growth rules of patients infected, dead and cured with 2019 novel coronavirus in mainland China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.23.20024802</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.23.20024802</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background An outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) was first occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and then spread rapidly to other regions. It has been declared that at least one confirmed case infected by SARS-CoV-2 was found in each province of China by late January 2020. Methods We collected the time series data of the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases from the health commissions in 31 provinces in mainland China. A simple descriptive model in a logistic form was formulated to infer the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19. Furthermore, we compared the intrinsic epidemic rules of COVID-19 in Hubei with that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing, which was obtained from the Ministry of Public Health of China in 2003. Results The feature of data of three population groups in all the provinces could be well captured (R-square&gt;0.95) by the proposed descriptive model with slight variation among different provinces. By comparing fitted parameters, we found that the fitted curve of the infected case is the earliest to be saturated and has the lowest semi-saturation period in both COVID-19 and SARS. While all three population groups of SARS are later to saturate and have a longer semi-saturation period than that of COVID-19. Conclusions Our model is robust and stable to depict the intrinsic growth rule for the cumulative number of confirmed infected, dead, and cured cases in 30 provinces, which could depict the epidemic situation in mainland China very well. Despite the virus caused SARS (SARS-CoV) and the virus caused COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) are homologous, their epidemiologic characteristics are quite different. The duration of the outbreak would be shorter for COVID-19.

It is being treated as a Class A infectious disease though it was classified as Class B according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act of China. Accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control. However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period though it is believed that symptoms of COVID-19 can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 or even more after exposure. The accurate incubation period calculation requires original chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the Wuhan regions. In this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the Wuhan regions. Methods: We acquired and collected officially reported COVID-19 data from 10 regions in China except for Hubei province. To achieve the accurate calculation of the incubation period, we only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset. We excluded those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in Wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time. We proposed a Monte Caro simulation approach to estimate the incubation of COVID-19 as well as employed nonparametric ways. We also employed manifold learning and related statistical analysis to decipher the incubation relationships between different age/gender groups. Result: The incubation period of COVID-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions. We estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the incubation periods of the groups with age&gt;=40 years and age&lt;40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. The former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter. It further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different incubation periods. Our machine learning analysis also showed that the two groups were linearly separable. incubation of COVID-19 along with previous statistical analysis. Our results further indicated that the incubation difference between males and females did not demonstrate a statistical significance.

In such a situation, allowing some infections to occur in lower-risk groups might lead to an overall greater reduction in mortality than trying to protect everyone equally.

The susceptible individ- uals are assumed to move stochastically from one place to another. The virus particle transmission rate is assumed to obey the Eyring rate process theory and also controlled by how much free volume available in a system. The transmission process is considered to be a sequential chemical reaction, and the concentrations or fractions of four epidemiological compartments, the susceptible, the exposed, the infected, and the removed, can be derived and calculated. The obtained equations show that the basic reproduction number, R0, is not a constant, dependent on the volume frac- tion of virus particles, virus particle size, and virus particle packing structure, the energy barrier associated with susceptible individuals, and environment temperature. The developed models are applied to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) transmission and make predictions on peak time, peak infected, and R0. Our work provides a simple and straightforward approach to estimate how infection diseases evolve and how many people may be infected.

Since then, there have been over 4000 cases globally of the 2019 novel coronavirus (n-CoV) and over 100 deaths. Outbreaks of novel agents represent opportunities for clinical research to inform real-time public health action. In 2018, we conducted a systematic review to identify priority research questions for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Here, we review information available on 2019 n-CoV and provide an evidenced-based framework for priority clinical research in the 2019 n-CoV outbreak. Methodology: Three bibliographic databases were searched to identify clinical studies published on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in the outbreak setting. Studies were grouped thematically according to clinical research questions addressed. In January 2020, available information on 2019 n-CoV was reviewed and compared to the results of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV systematic review. Results: From the research objectives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, ten themes in the literature were identified: Clinical characterisation, prognosis, diagnosis, clinical management, viral pathogenesis, epidemiological characterisation, infection prevention and control/transmission, susceptibility, psychosocial, and aetiology. For 2019 n-CoV, some information on clinical presentation, diagnostic testing, and aetiology is available but many clinical research gaps have yet to be filled. Interpretation: Based on a systematic review of other severe coronaviruses, we summarise the state of clinical research for 2019 n-CoV, highlight the research gaps, and provide recommendations for the implementation of standardised protocols. Data based on internationally standardised protocols will inform clinical practice real-time.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>He, Jiahua</author><author>Tao, Huanyu</author><author>Yan, Yumeng</author><author>Huang, Sheng-You</author><author>Xiao, Yi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Molecular mechanism of evolution and human infection with the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.17.952903</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.17.952903</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Since December, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has hit the city of Wuhan in the Hubei Province. With the continuous development of the epidemic, it has become a national public health crisis and calls for urgent antiviral treatments or vaccines. The spike protein on the coronavirus envelope is critical for host cell infection and virus vitality. Previous studies showed that 2019-nCoV is highly homologous to human SARS-CoV and attaches host cells though the binding of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) domain to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). However, the molecular mechanisms of 2019- nCoV binding to human ACE2 and evolution of 2019-nCoV remain unclear. In this study, we have extensively studied the RBD-ACE2 complex, spike protein, and free RBD systems of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It was shown that the RBD-ACE2 binding free energy for 2019-nCoV is significantly lower than that for SARS-CoV, which is consistent the fact that 2019-nCoV is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. In addition, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV shows a significantly lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that 2019-nCoV is more stable and able to survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This may also provide insights into the evolution of 2019-nCoV because SARS-like coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats that are known to have a higher body-temperature than humans. It was also revealed that the RBD of 2019-nCoV is much more flexible especially near the binding site and thus will have a higher entropy penalty upon binding ACE2, compared to the RBD of SARS-CoV. That means that 2019-nCoV will be much more temperature-sensitive in terms of human infection than SARS-CoV. With the rising temperature, 2019-nCoV is expected to decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV, and get controlled more easily. The present findings are expected to be helpful for the disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development of 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>He, Xi</author><author>Lau, Eric HY</author><author>Wu, Peng</author><author>Deng, Xilong</author><author>Wang, Jian</author><author>Hao, Xinxin</author><author>Lau, Yiu Chung</author><author>Wong, Jessica Y</author><author>Guan, Yujuan</author><author>Tan, Xinghua</author><author>Mo, Xiaoneng</author><author>Chen, Yanqing</author><author>Liao, Baolin</author><author>Chen, Weilie</author><author>Hu, Fengyu</author><author>Zhang, Qing</author><author>Zhong, Mingqiu</author><author>Wu, Yanrong</author><author>Zhao, Lingzhai</author><author>Zhang, Fuchun</author><author>Cowling, Benjamin J</author><author>Li, Fang</author><author>Leung, Gabriel M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temporal dynamics in viral shedding and transmissibility of COVID-19</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.15.20036707</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.15.20036707</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>We report temporal patterns of viral shedding in 94 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and modelled COVID-19 infectiousness profile from a separate sample of 77 infector-infectee transmission pairs.

Analyzing the distribution and expression level of the route of coronavirus may help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different, suggesting relatively similar susceptibility, which was consistent with current clinical observations. Moreover, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the virus rapidly spreads all over the world and takes thousands of lives in just two months. To assess illness and fatality risk of the viral infection is exceedingly helpful to ensure effective management of the general public and patients in the outbreak. Therefore, it is critical to quantify illness and fatality risk of COVID-19 for the general public. In this report, we investigate the illness and fatality risk of the infection by analyzing the age composition of 5319 infected patients, 76 mortality cases, and 1,144,648 individuals of the general public in China. Our result shows a relatively low illness risk for young people but a very high fatality risk for seniors. Notably, fatality risk could be as high as 0.48 for people older than 80 years. Furthermore, our study suggests that a good medical service can effectively reduce the mortality rate of the viral infection to 1% or less. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work was supported by grants from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31871255 and 91731310 to Y.H.) and Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project (Grant No. 2017SHZDZX01). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Nevertheless, estimating $R_0$ for every transmissible pathogen, emerging or endemic, remains a priority for epidemiologists the world over. Although often used to compare outbreaks and forecast pandemic risk, this single number belies the complexity that two different pathogens can exhibit, even when they have the same $R_0$. Here, we show how predicting outbreak size requires both an estimate of $R_0$ and an estimate of the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. To facilitate rapid determination of outbreak risk, we propose a reformulation of a classic result from random network theory that relies on contact tracing data to simultaneously determine the first moment ($R_0$) and the higher moments (representing the heterogeneity) in the distribution of secondary infections. Further, we show how this framework is robust in the face of the typically limited amount of data for emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging pathogens like 2019-nCoV, the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically, in the case of 2019-nCoV from 5-40\% of susceptible individuals. Taken together, our work highlights the critical need for contact tracing during emerging infectious disease outbreaks and the need to look beyond $R_0$ when predicting epidemic size.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hellewell, Joel</author><author>Abbott, Sam</author><author>Gimma, Amy</author><author>Bosse, Nikos I</author><author>Jarvis, Christopher I</author><author>Russell, Timothy W</author><author>Munday, James D</author><author>Kucharski, Adam J</author><author>Edmunds, W John</author><author>Funk, Sebastian</author><author>Eggo, Rosalind M</author><author>Sun, Fiona</author><author>Flasche, Stefan</author><author>Quilty, Billy J</author><author>Davies, Nicholas</author><author>Liu, Yang</author><author>Clifford, Samuel</author><author>Klepac, Petra</author><author>Jit, Mark</author><author>Diamond, Charlie</author><author>Gibbs, Hamish</author><author>van Zandvoort, Kevin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Feasibility of controlling COVID-19 outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts</title><secondary-title>The Lancet Global Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet Global Health</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Lancet Glob Health</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30074-7</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2214109X20300747</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hellewell, Joel</author><author>Abbott, Sam</author><author>Gimma, Amy</author><author>Bosse, Nikos I</author><author>Jarvis, Christopher I</author><author>Russell, Timothy W</author><author>Munday, James D</author><author>Kucharski, Adam J</author><author>Edmunds, W John</author><author>group, CMMID nCoV working</author><author>Funk, Sebastian</author><author>Eggo, Rosalind M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Feasibility of controlling 2019-nCoV outbreaks by isolation of cases and contacts</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.08.20021162</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.08.20021162</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: To assess the viability of isolation and contact tracing to control onwards transmission from imported cases of 2019-nCoV. Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 nCoV-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number R0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. Findings: While simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, R0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher R0, and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. For R0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks. The delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of R0. For higher values of R0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Interpretation: We found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-nCov within three months. The probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.

Though both the number of cases and mortality rate in children and adolescents is reported to be low in comparison to adults, limited data has been reported on the outbreak with respect to pediatric patients. To elucidate information, we utilized crowdsourced data to perform a preliminary epidemiologic analysis of pediatric patients with COVID-19 Methods: In this observational study, data was collected from two open-access, line list crowdsourced online databases. Pediatric cases of COVID-19 were defined as patients ≤19 years of age with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. The primary outcomes were case counts and cumulative case counts. Secondary outcomes included days between symptoms onset and first medical care and days between first medical care and reporting. Tertiary outcomes were rate of travel to Wuhan, rate of infected family members and rates of symptoms. Results: A total of 82 patients were included. The median age was 10 [IQR: 5-15] years. Patients from mainland China (outside Hubei) accounted for 46.3% of cases, while the remaining 53.7% of cases were international. Males and females accounted for 52.4% and 32.9% of cases, respectively, with the remaining 14.6% being designated as unknown. A male skew persisted across subgroup analyses by age group (p=1.0) and location (inside/outside China) (p=0.22). While the number of reported international cases has been steadily increasing over the study period, the number of reported cases in China rapidly decreased from the start point. The median reporting delay was 3 [IQR: 2-4.8] days. The median delay between symptom onset and first seeking medical care was 1 [IQR: 0-3.25] day. In international cases, time to first seeking medical care was a median of 2.5 days longer than in China (p=0.04). When clinical features were reported, fever was the most common presentation (68.0%), followed by cough (36.0%). Conclusions: The number of reported international pediatric COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing. COVID-19 infections are, to-date, more common in males than females in both the children and adolescent age groups. Additionally, this male predominance remains the case both inside and outside of China. Crowdsourced data enabled early analysis of epidemiologic variables in pediatric patients with COVID-19. Further data sharing is required to enable analyses that are required to understand the course of this infection in children.

In addition, all available data up to February 3 were processed the same way. For the first period the cumulative number of cases followed an exponential function. However, from January 28, we discerned a downward deviation from the exponential growth. This slower-than-exponential growth was also confirmed by a steady decline of the effective reproduction number. A backtrend analysis suggested the original basic reproduction number R0 to be about 2.4 to 2.5. We used a simple logistic growth model that fitted very well with all data reported until the time of writing . Using this model and the first set of data, we estimate that the maximum cases will be about 21,000 reaching this level in mid-February. Using all available data the maximum number of cases is somewhat higher at 29,000 but its dynamics does not change. These predictions do not account for any possible other secondary sources of infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe funding agencies had no role in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; or decision to submit the manuscript for publication.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms could improve both patient care and public health responses. However, the potential impact of such a host-based early warning system on containing the spread of an outbreak and in steering public health response is unknown. Methods: We extend the deterministic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered) model to simulate disease outbreak scenarios and to quantify the potential impact of a host-based early warning capability to mitigate pathogen transmission during an outbreak. In particular, we compare and contrast the performance of five different policies: Self-monitoring and reporting (baseline SEIR model), Quarantining the entire population, Quarantine-on-alert (with high sensitivity early warning), Quarantine-on-alert (with high specificity early warning), and Quarantine-on-alert (ideal early warning). We further evaluate these five policy options against four different outbreak scenarios with high or low disease transmission and high or low initial population exposures. Results: For all scenarios, a quarantine-on-alert policy coupled with the near-ideal early warning capability reduces quarantine needs with only a small increase in the number of additional infections. The cost of a highly specific early detection system (i.e., a reduction in false alarms and thus quarantine costs) is an increase in additional infections relative to the near-ideal system. Conversely, a highly sensitive early detection system increases the percentage of the population in quarantine compared to both the ideal and high-specificity early detection system while also reducing the number of additional infections to nearly the numbers seen by quarantining the entire population a priori. Conclusions: Our simulations demonstrate the utility of host-based early warning systems in controlling an outbreak under various outbreak conditions. Our tools also provide a simulation capability for evaluating public health policies enabling quantitative evaluation of their impacts prior to implementation. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Clinical Trial No clinical trial conducted ### Funding Statement This work is funded by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

In this case, estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio ( R ) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread - with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that R  will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly.

Coronaviruses use their spike proteins to select and enter target cells and insights into nCoV-2019 spike (S)-driven entry might facilitate assessment of pandemic potential and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that 2019-nCoV-S uses the SARS-coronavirus receptor, ACE2, for entry and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for 2019-nCoV-S priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the serum form a convalescent SARS patient neutralized 2019-nCoV-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between 2019-nCoV and SARS-coronavirus infection, which might translate into similar transmissibility and disease pathogenesis. Moreover, they identify a target for antiviral intervention.One sentence summary The novel 2019 coronavirus and the SARS-coronavirus share central biological properties which can guide risk assessment and intervention.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Holshue, Michelle L</author><author>DeBolt, Chas</author><author>Lindquist, Scott</author><author>Lofy, Kathy H</author><author>Wiesman, John</author><author>Bruce, Hollianne</author><author>Spitters, Christopher</author><author>Ericson, Keith</author><author>Wilkerson, Sara</author><author>Tural, Ahmet</author><author>Diaz, George</author><author>Cohn, Amanda</author><author>Fox, LeAnne</author><author>Patel, Anita</author><author>Gerber, Susan I</author><author>Kim, Lindsay</author><author>Tong, Suxiang</author><author>Lu, Xiaoyan</author><author>Lindstrom, Steve</author><author>Pallansch, Mark A</author><author>Weldon, William C</author><author>Biggs, Holly M</author><author>Uyeki, Timothy M</author><author>Pillai, Satish K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States</title><secondary-title>New England Journal of Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New England Journal of Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>NEJMoa2001191</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Massachusetts Medical Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1056/NEJMoa2001191</electronic-resource-num><notes>doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2001191</notes><research-notes>doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2001191</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191</url><url>http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hong, Na</author><author>He, Jie</author><author>Ma, Yingying</author><author>Jiang, Huizhen</author><author>Han, Lin</author><author>Su, Longxiang</author><author>Zhu, Weiguo</author><author>Long, Yun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating the secondary transmission pattern and epidemic prediction of the COVID-19 in metropolitan areas of China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.06.20032177</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.06.20032177</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Understanding the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is crucial for evaluating the spread pattern of it, especially in metropolitan areas of China which may cause secondary outbreaks outside Wuhan, the center of the new coronavirus disease outbreak. We used reported data from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 23, 2020, fitted the model of infection, and on the number of cases reported to estimate likely number of infections in four high risk metropolitan areas, as well as facilitate understanding the COVID-19's spread pattern. A group of SERI model statistical parameters were estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and our modeling integrated the effect of the official quarantine regulation and travel restriction of China. As a result, we estimated that the basic reproductive number R0 ​is 3.11 in Beijing, 2.78 in Shanghai, 2.02 in Guangzhou, and 1.75 in Shenzhen. In addition, we inferred the prediction results and compared the results of different level of parameters, For example, In Beijing, the predicated peak number of cases is around 466 at the peak time Feb 29, 2020; however, when the city conducts different levels (strict, mild, or weak) of travel restrictions or regulation measures, the estimation results show that transmission dynamics will change and the peek number of cases shows the changing proportion is between 56%~159%. We concluded that public health interventions would reduce the risks of COVID-19 spreading and more rigorous control and prevention measures will effectively contain its further spread, but risk increases when businesses and social activities returning back before the ending date. Besides, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China are potential to provide evidences supporting for other metropolitan areas and big cities with emerging cases outside China.

Design The study was an observational, descriptive study. Setting This study was carried out in a tertiary hospital in Guangdong, China. Participants 12 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 20, 2020 to February 20, 2020. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was to evaluate the incidence of early renal injury in COVID-19. In this study, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), endogenous creatinine clearance (Ccr) and urine microalbumin / urinary creatinine ratio (UACR) were calculated to assess the incidence of early renal injury. Secondary outcomes were the diagnostic value of urine microalbumin (UMA), α1-microglobulin (A1M), urine immunoglobulin-G (IGU), urine transferring (TRU) alone and in combination in diagnosis of COVID-19 with early renal injury. Results While all patients had no significant abnormalities in serum creatinine (Scr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), the abnormal rates of eGFR, Ccr, and UACR were 66.7%, 41.7%, and 41.7%, respectively. Urinary microprotein detection indicated that the area under curve (AUC) of multi-index combined to diagnose early renal injury in COVID-19 was 0.875, which was higher than UMA (0,813), A1M (0.813), IGU (0.750) and TRU (0.750) alone. Spearman analysis showed that the degree of early renal injury was significantly related to C-reactive protein (CRP) and neutrophil ratio (NER), suggesting that the more severe the infection, the more obvious the early renal injury. Hypokalemia and hyponatremia were common in patients with COVID-19, and there was a correlation with the degree of renal injury. Conclusions Early renal injury was common in patients with COVID-19. Combined detection of UMA, A1M, IGU, and TRU was helpful for the diagnosis of early renal injury in COVID-19.

Many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread. We have developed an “easy-to-use” mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread. Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproductive number R = 2.92 and latent period τ = 5.2 days. Next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through a high intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low R (1.4), if the R is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures. This suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions. The study allows us to assess the effects of border control and quarantine measures on the emergence and the global spread in a fully connected world using the dynamics of the secondary cases.

The demand for rapid and accurate diagnosis of this novel pathogen brought significant clinical and technological challenges. Currently, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) are the most widely used molecular diagnostics. Methods: 2019-nCoV infections were confirmed in 52 specimens by mNGS. Genomic information was analyzed and used for the design and development of an isothermal, CRISPR-based diagnostic for this novel virus. The diagnostic performance of CRISPR-nCoV was assessed and compared across three technology platforms (mNGS, RT-PCR and CRISPR). Results: 2019-nCoVs sequenced in our study were conserved with the Wuhan strain, and shared certain genetic similarity with SARS-CoV. A high degree of variation in the level of viral RNA was observed in clinical specimens. CRISPR-nCoV demonstrated a near single-copy sensitivity and great clinical sensitivity with a shorter turn-around time than RT-PCR. Conclusion: CRISPR-nCoV presents as a promising diagnostic option for the emerging pathogen. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement National Major Science &amp; Technology Project for Control and Prevention of Major Infectious Diseases in China; Guangdong Science and Technology Department ;Guangzhou Science, Technology and Innovation Commission ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Methods A population-based cross-sectional telephone survey via random dialing was conducted in Wuhan (the epicentre) and Shanghai (an affected city with imported cases) between 1 and 10 February, 2020. 510 residents in Wuhan and 501 residents in Shanghai were randomly sampled. Differences of outcome measures were compared before and during the outbreak, and between two cities. Findings Proportion of respondents visiting wet markets at usual was 23.3% (119/510) in Wuhan and 20.4% (102/501) in Shanghai. During the outbreak, it decreased to 3.1% (16) in Wuhan (p&lt;0.001), and 4.4% (22) in Shanghai (p&lt;0.001). Proportion of those consuming wild animal products declined from 10.2% (52) to 0.6% (3) in Wuhan (p&lt;0.001), and from 5.2% (26) to 0.8% (4) in Shanghai (p&lt;0.001). 79.0% (403) of respondents in Wuhan and 66.9% (335) of respondents in Shanghai supported permanent closure of wet markets (P&lt;0.001). 95% and 92% of respondents supported banning wild animal trade and quarantining Wuhan, and 75% were confident towards containment measures. Females and the more educated were more supportive for the above containment measures. Interpretation The public responded quickly to the outbreak, and reduced exposure to live animals, especially in Wuhan. With high public support in containment measures, better regulation of wet markets and healthy diets should be promoted.

However, the development of effective vaccine for this novel virus would take a few months. Thus it is urgent to identify some potentially effective old drugs that can be used immediately. Fortunately, some compounds that can inhibit coronavirus in vitro have been reported. In this study, the coronavirus-specific dataset was used to fine-tune our pre-trained multi-task deep model. Next we used the re-trained model to select available commercial drugs against targeted proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The results show that abacavir, a powerful nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor used to treat HIV, is predicted to have high binding affinity with several proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Almitrine mesylate and roflumilast which are used for respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are also predicted to have inhibitory effect. Overall, ten drugs are listed as potential inhibitors and the important sites for these binding by our model are exhibited. We hope these results would be useful in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hu, Xiumei</author><author>An, Taixue</author><author>Situ, Bo</author><author>Hu, Yuhai</author><author>Ou, Zihao</author><author>Li, Qiang</author><author>He, Xiaojing</author><author>Zhang, Ye</author><author>Tian, Peifu</author><author>Sun, Dehua</author><author>Rui, Yongyu</author><author>Wang, Qian</author><author>Ding, Dan</author><author>Zheng, Lei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Heat inactivation of serum interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.12.20034231</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.12.20034231</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;not added;reviewed</label><abstract>The detection of serum antibodies to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is emerging as a new tool for the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis. Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56 ℃ prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is still unclear. By comparing the levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56 ℃ for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay, we shown that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from COVID-19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. The IgG levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. Similar changes can also be observed in the non-COVID-19 diseases group (n=9). Of note, 44.12% of the detected IgM levels were dropped below the cut-off value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false-negative results of these samples. Our results indicate that heat inactivation of serum at 56 ℃ for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Heat inactivation prior to immunoanalysis is not recommended and the possibility of false-negative results should be considered if the sample was pre-inactivated by heating.

Limited data are available for asymptomatic infections. This study aims to present the clinical characteristics of 24 cases with asymptomatic infection screened from close contacts and to show the transmission potential of asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers. Methods: Epidemiological investigations were conducted among all close contacts of COVID-19 patients (or suspected patients) in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, from Jan 28 to Feb 9, 2020, both in clinic and in community. Asymptomatic carriers were laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus by testing the nucleic acid of the pharyngeal swab samples. Their clinical records, laboratory assessments, and chest CT scans were reviewed. Findings: None of the 24 asymptomatic cases presented any obvious symptoms before nucleic acid screening. Five cases (20.8%) developed symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue and etc.) during hospitalization. Twelve (50.0%) cases showed typical CT images of ground-glass chest and five (20.8%) presented stripe shadowing in the lungs. The remaining seven (29.2%) cases showed normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization. These seven cases were younger (median age: 14.0 years; P = 0.012) than the rest. None of the 24 cases developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died. The median communicable period, defined as the interval from the first day of positive nucleic acid tests to the first day of continuous negative tests, was 9.5 days (up to 21 days among the 24 asymptomatic cases). Through epidemiological investigation, we observed a typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Interpretation: The asymptomatic carriers identified from close contacts were prone to be mildly ill during hospitalization. However, the communicable period could be up to three weeks and the communicated patients could develop severe illness. These results highlighted the importance of close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Further isolation recommendation and continuous nucleic acid tests may also be recommended to the patients discharged. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This study was funded in part by the project of Jiangsu province medical youth talent (QNRC2016059), Nanjing medical science and technique development foundation (ZKX17040 and YKK18153), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (81903382), Cheung Kong Scholars Programme of China. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

To help governments with policy-making, we developed modified auto-encoders (MAE) method to forecast spread trajectory of Covid-19 of countries affected, under different levels and timing of intervention strategies. Our analysis showed public health interventions should be executed as soon as possible. Delaying intervention 4 weeks after March 8, 2020 would cause the maximum number of cumulative cases of death increase from 7,174 to 133,608 and the ending points of the epidemic postponed from Jun 25 to Aug 22.

Changsha, a city located south to the epicenter, was soon impacted. To control the transmission of the coronavirus and avoid nosocomial infection, triage procedures based on epidemiology were implemented in a local hospital of the city. This retrospective study analyzed the data collected during the triage period and found that COVID-19 patients were enriched seven folds into the Section A designated for rapid detection and quarantine. On the other side, roughly triple amounts of visits were received at the Section B for patients without obvious epidemiological history. Eight COVID-19 cases were spotted out of 247 suspected patients. More than 50% of the suspected patients were submitted to multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 239 patients who were diagnosed as negative of the virus infection,188 were successfully revisited and none was reported as a COVID-19 case. Of the eight COVID-19 patients, three were confirmed only after multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis. Besides comorbidities, delayed sharing of epidemiological history added another layer of complexity to the diagnosis in practice. While SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is being alerted in many countries, our report will be helpful to other colleagues in rapid identification of COVID-19 cases and controlling the transmission of the disease.

Due to COVID-19 spreads quickly, is highly contagious, and can be fatal in severe cases, and there are no specific medicines, it poses a huge threat to the life and health of nurses and has a large impact on their emotional responses and coping strategies. Methods: This study conducted an online questionnaire survey from February 1 to 9, 2020 to investigate the current state of emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses and college nursing students in Anhui Province. This study used a modified Brief COPE (Carver, 1997) and a emotional responses scale. Results: The results found that women showed more severe anxiety and fear than men. Participants from cities showed more anxiety and fear than participants from rural, but rural participants showed more sadness than urban participants. The closer COVID-19 is to the participants, the stronger the anxiety and anger. Compared with Nursing college students, nurses have stronger emotional responses and are more willing to use Problem-focused coping. People may have a cycle of &quot;the more fear, the more problem-focused coping&quot;. And people may &quot;The more angry, the more emotion-focused coping&quot;, &quot;the more problem-focused coping, the more anxious, the more angry, the more sadness&quot;. Conclusion: COVID-19 is a pressure source with great influence, both for individuals and for the social public groups. Different individuals and groups may experience different levels of psychological crisis, and those nurses at the core of the incident are affected. Hospitals should focus on providing psychological support to nurses and providing timely psychological assistance and training in coping strategies. Improving nurses' ability to regulate emotions and effective coping strategies, providing a strong guarantee for resolutely winning the battle against epidemic prevention and control. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This study was supported by Anhui province philosophy and social science planning project of China (AHSKQ2019D059). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. Here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoV S-protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) with human receptor ACE2, based on experimental SARS-CoV S-RBD-ACE2 complex structure. By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-nCoV via comparison with SARS-CoV. Our results show that this binding affinity is about 73% of that of SARS-CoV, supporting that 2019-nCoV may cause human transmission similar to that of SARS-CoV. Thus, this study presents a method for rapidly assessing the human transmission capability of a newly emerged CoV and its mutant strains, and demonstrates that post-genome analysis of protein-protein interactions may provide early scientific guidance for viral prevention and control.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Yeen</author><author>Zhao, Ning</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generalized anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms and sleep quality during COVID-19 epidemic in China: a web-based cross-sectional survey</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.19.20025395</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.19.20025395</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Huang, Zhao - 2020 - Generalized anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms and sleep quality during COVID-19 epidemic in China a web-based c.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: China has been severely affected by COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) since December, 2019. This study aimed to assess the population mental health burden during the epidemic, and to explore the potential influence factors. Methods: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 603 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depression (CES-D), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Logistic regression were used to identify influence factors associated with mental health problem. Results: Of the total sample analyzed, the overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were 34.0%, 18.1%, and 18.1%, respectively. Young people reported a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms than older people (P=0.024). Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers have the highest rate of poor sleep quality (P=0.045). Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (&lt; 35 years) and times to focus on the COVID-19 (≥ 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were associated with poor sleep quality. Conclusions: Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during COVID-19 epidemic in China. Young people, people who spent too much time on the epidemic, and healthcare workers were at high risk for mental illness. Continuous surveillance and monitoring of the psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.

We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of non-survivors with COVID-19. Methods For this retrospective, single-center study, we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 14, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation. Results We included 36 patients who died from COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). 25(69.44%) patients were males, and 11 (30.56%) female. 26 (72.22%) patients had chronic diseases, mainly including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Patients had common clinical symptoms of fever (34 [94.44%] patients), cough (28 [77.78%] patients), shortness of breath (21 [58.33%] patients), and fatigue (17 [47.22%] patient). Chest computed tomographic scans showed that 31 (96.88%) patients had bilateral pneumonia. Lymphopenia occurred in 24 patients (70.59%), decreased albumin (30.18, [SD, 4.76]) in 25 patients (80.65%), elevated D-dimer (8.64 [IQR, 2.39-20]) in 27 patients (100%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (502.5 U/L [IQR, 410-629]) in 26 patients (100%). Nearly all of the patients have elevated CRP (106.3 mg/L [IQR, 60.83-225.3]), PCT (0.61 ng/ml [IQR, 0.16-2.10]) and IL-6 (100.6 pg/ml [IQR, 51.51-919.5]). Most patients received antiviral therapy and antibiotic therapy, and more than half of patients received glucocorticoid therapy (25 [69.44%]). All the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. One (2.78%) patient presented with acute renal injury. The median time from onset to death was 17 days. Interpretation Lots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were common, and need to be monitored in the routine treatment.

Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, 41 consecutive corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) patients (including 2 deaths) of COVID-2019 in Beijing Youan Hospital, China Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020, were involved in this study. The high risk factors of cardiac injury in different COVID-2019 patients were analyzed. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) has been used to demonstrate the cardiac inflammation of COVID-2019. Results：Of the 41 COVID-2019 patients, 2 (4.88%), 32 (78.05%), 4 (9.75%) and 3 (7.32%) patients were clinically diagnosed as light, mild, severe and critical cases, according to the 6th guidance issued by the National Health Commission of China. 10 (24.4%) patients had underlying complications, such as hypertension, CAD, type 2 diabetes mellites and tumor. The peak value of TnI in critical patients is 40-fold more than normal value. 2 patients in the critical group had the onset of atrial fibrillation, and the peak heart rates reached up to 160 bpm. CT scan showed low EAT density in severe and critical patients. Conclusion: Our results indicated that cardiac injury of COVID-2019 was rare in light and mild patients, while common in severe and critical patients. Therefore, the monitoring of the heart functions of COVID-2019 patients and applying potential interventions for those with abnormal cardiac injury related characteristics, is vital to prevent the fatality.

From this baseline we subtract the expected reduction in the number of passengers taking into account the temporary ban of some routes which was put in place since 23 January 2020 following the COVID-2019 Coronavirus outbreak. The results indicate a reduction of the number of passengers in the period January - March 2020 of -2.5%. This calculation considers only the complete closure of routes (not just direct flights) and not the reduction in the number of passengers on still active direct and indirect connections. At the moment of writing, with such partial information it is premature to quantify economic losses on the civil air transport and tourism industry. This note is meant to provide a baseline that be extended to all countries of origin and updated as more recent data will become available.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ibrahim, Ibrahim M.</author><author>Abdelmalek, Doaa H.</author><author>Elshahat, Mohammed E.</author><author>Elfiky, Abdo A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>COVID-19 Spike-host cell receptor GRP78 binding site prediction</title><secondary-title>Journal of Infection</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Infection</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>J Infect</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.026</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0163445320301079</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;not added;reviewed</label><abstract>Objectives: Understanding the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) mode of host cell recognition may help to fight the disease and save lives. The spike protein of coronaviruses is the main driving force for host cell recognition.

Methods: In this study, the COVID-19 spike binding site to the cell-surface receptor (Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78)) is predicted using combined molecular modeling docking and structural bioinformatics. The COVID-19 spike protein is modeled using its counterpart, the SARS spike.

Results: Sequence and structural alignments show that four regions, in addition to its cyclic nature have sequence and physicochemical similarities to the cyclic Pep42. Protein-protein docking was performed to test the four regions of the spike that fit tightly in the GRP78 Substrate Binding Domain β (SBDβ). The docking pose revealed the involvement of the SBDβ of GRP78 and the receptor-binding domain of the coronavirus spike protein in recognition of the host cell receptor.

Conclusions: We reveal that the binding is more favorable between regions III (C391-C525) and IV (C480-C488) of the spike protein model and GRP78. Region IV is the main driving force for GRP78 binding with the predicted binding affinity of -9.8 kcal/mol. These nine residues can be used to develop therapeutics specific against COVID-19.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Imai, Natsuko</author><author>Cori, Anne</author><author>Dorigatti, Ilaria</author><author>Baguelin, Marc</author><author>Donnelly, Christl A</author><author>Riley, Steven</author><author>Ferguson, Neil M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Report 3: Transmissibility of 2019-nCoV</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Imai et al. - Unknown - Report 3 Transmissibility of 2019-nCoV.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;report;reviewed</label><abstract>Note: This is an extended version of an analysis previously shared with WHO, governments and academic networks between 22/1/20-24/1/20 Summary Self-sustaining human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is the only plausible explanation of the scale of the outbreak in Wuhan. We estimate that, on average, each case infected 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5-3.5) other people up to 18 th January 2020, based on an analysis combining our past estimates of the size of the outbreak in Wuhan with computational modelling of potential epidemic trajectories. This implies that control measures need to block well over 60% of transmission to be effective in controlling the outbreak. It is likely, based on the experience of SARS and MERS-CoV, that the number of secondary cases caused by a case of 2019-nCoV is highly variable-with many cases causing no secondary infections, and a few causing many. Whether transmission is continuing at the same rate currently depends on the effectiveness of current control measures implemented in China and the extent to which the populations of affected areas have adopted risk-reducing behaviours. In the absence of antiviral drugs or vaccines, control relies upon the prompt detection and isolation of symptomatic cases. It is unclear at the current time whether this outbreak can be contained within China; uncertainties include the severity spectrum of the disease caused by this virus and whether cases with relatively mild symptoms are able to transmit the virus efficiently. Identification and testing of potential cases need to be as extensive as is permitted by healthcare and diagnostic testing capacity-including the identification, testing and isolation of suspected cases with only mild to moderate disease (e.g. influenza-like illness), when logistically feasible.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Report">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Imai, Natsuko</author><author>Dorigatti, Ilaria</author><author>Cori, Anne</author><author>Donnelly, Christl</author><author>Riley, Steven</author><author>Ferguson, Neil M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating the potential total number of novel Coronavirus cases in Wuhan City, China V2 (updated to include second Thai case)</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Imai et al. - 2020 - Estimating the potential total number of novel Coronavirus cases in Wuhan City, China V2 (updated to include second.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;report;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Incident Room Surveillance Team, National</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Communicable Diseases Intelligence 2020 - COVID-19, Australia: Epidemiology Report 3: Reporting week ending 19:00 AEDT 15 February 2020</title></titles><periodical/><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>Australia</keyword><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>SARS-CoV-2</keyword><keyword>acute respiratory disease</keyword><keyword>case definition</keyword><keyword>coronavirus disease 2019</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>novel coronavirus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.33321/cdi.2020.44.15</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2020.44.15</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;group author;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Iwata, Kentaro</author><author>Miyakoshi, Chisato</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Simulation on Potential Secondary Spread of Novel Coronavirus in an Exported Country Using a Stochastic Epidemic SEIR Model</title><secondary-title>Preprints (www.preprints.org)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Preprints (www.preprints.org)</full-title></periodical><pages>4-9</pages><issue>February</issue><keywords><keyword>novel coronavirus</keyword><keyword>outside china</keyword><keyword>seir model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Preprints</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.20944/preprints202002.0179.v1</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and the number of new patients continues to increase. On the contrary to ongoing outbreak in China, however, there are limited secondary outbreaks caused by exported case outside the country. We here conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks at a community outside China. Simulations using stochastic SEIR model was conducted, assuming one patient was imported to a community. Among 45 possible scenarios we prepared, the worst scenario resulted in total number of persons recovered or removed to be 997 (95% CrI 990-1,000) at day 100 and maximum number of symptomatic infectious patients per day of 335 (95% CrI 232-478). Calculated mean basic reproductive number (R0) was 6.5 (Interquartile range, IQR 5.6-7.2). However, with good case scenarios with different parameter led to no secondary case. Altering parameters, especially time to hospital visit could change the impact of secondary outbreak. With this multiple scenarios with different parameters, healthcare professionals might be able to prepare for this viral infection better.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jackson, Michael L</author><author>Hart, Gregory R</author><author>McCulloch, Denise J</author><author>Adler, Amanda</author><author>Brandstetter, Elisabeth</author><author>Fay, Kairsten</author><author>Han, Peter</author><author>Lacombe, Kirsten</author><author>Lee, Jover</author><author>Sibley, Thomas</author><author>Nickerson, Deborah A</author><author>Rieder, Mark</author><author>Starita, Lea</author><author>Englund, Janet A</author><author>Bedford, Trevor</author><author>Chu, Helen</author><author>Famulare, Michael</author><author>Investigators, the Seattle Flu Study</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of weather-related social distancing on city-scale transmission of respiratory viruses</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.02.20027599</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.02.20027599</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>BACKGROUND: Unusually high snowfall in western Washington State in February 2019 led to widespread school and workplace closures. We assessed the impact of social distancing caused by this extreme weather event on the transmission of respiratory viruses. METHODS: Residual specimens from patients evaluated for acute respiratory illness at hospitals in the Seattle metropolitan area were screened for a panel of respiratory viruses. Transmission models were fit to each virus, with disruption of contact rates and care-seeking informed by data on local traffic volumes and hospital admissions. RESULTS: Disruption in contact patterns reduced effective contact rates during the intervention period by 16% to 95%, and cumulative disease incidence through the remainder of the season by 3% to 9%. Incidence reductions were greatest for viruses that were peaking when the disruption occurred and least for viruses in early epidemic phase. CONCLUSION: High-intensity, short-duration social distancing measures may substantially reduce total incidence in a respiratory virus epidemic if implemented near the epidemic peak.

Taxonomically 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-related bat coronaviruses, and it appears to share a common receptor with SARS-CoV (ACE-2). Here, we perform structural modeling of the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein. Our data provide support for the similar receptor utilization between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, despite a relatively low amino acid similarity in the receptor binding module. Compared to SARS-CoV, we identify an extended structural loop containing basic amino acids at the interface of the receptor binding (S1) and fusion (S2) domains, which we predict to be proteolytically-sensitive. We suggest this loop confers fusion activation and entry properties more in line with MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, and that the presence of this structural loop in 2019-nCoV may affect virus stability and transmission.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jain, Vageesh</author><author>Yuan, Jin-Min</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Systematic review and meta-analysis of predictive symptoms and comorbidities for severe COVID-19 infection</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.15.20035360</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.15.20035360</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>coronavirus;not added;reviewed</label><abstract>Background/introduction COVID−19, a novel coronavirus outbreak starting in China, is now a rapidly developing public health emergency of international concern. The clinical spectrum of COVID−19 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority. It has been noted that elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities are more vulnerable to more severe disease. However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID−19 severity. Method This study was prospectively registered on PROSPERO. A literature search was performed in three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health) for studies indexed up to 5th March 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and both also completed data extraction. Quality appraisal of studies was performed using the STROBE checklist. Random effects meta-analysis was performed for selected symptoms and comorbidities to identify those most associated with severe COVID−19 infection or ICU admission. Results Of the 2259 studies identified, 42 were selected after title and abstract analysis, and 7 studies (including 1813 COVID−19 patients) were chosen for inclusion. The ICU group were older (62.4 years) compared to the non-ICU group (46 years), with a significantly higher proportion of males (67.2% vs. 57.1%, p=0.04). Dyspnoea was the only significant symptom predictive for both severe disease (pOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.83 − 7.46) and ICU admission (pOR 6.55, 95% CI 4.28 − 10.0). Notwithstanding the low prevalence of COPD in severe disease and ICU-admitted groups (4.5% and 9.7%, respectively), COPD was the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease (pOR 6.42, 95% CI 2.44 − 16.9) and ICU admission (pOR 17.8, 95% CI 6.56 − 48.2). Cardiovascular disease and hypertension were also strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission. Those with CVD and hypertension were 4.4 (95% CI 2.64 − 7.47) and 3.7 (95% CI 2.22 − 5.99) times more likely to have an ICU admission respectively, compared to patients without the comorbidity. Conclusions Dyspnoea was the only symptom strongly predictive for both severe disease and ICU admission, and could be useful in guiding clinical management decisions early in the course of illness. When looking at ICU-admitted patients, who represent the more severe end of the spectrum of clinical severity, COPD patients are particularly vulnerable, and those with cardiovascular disease and hypertension are also at a high-risk of severe illness. To aid clinical assessment, risk stratification, efficient resource allocation, and targeted public health interventions, future research must aim to further define those at high-risk of severe illness with COVID−19.

Using in silico methods, we generated trypsin-based shotgun proteomics methods optimized for LCMS systems from 5 commercial instrument vendors (Thermo, SCIEX, Waters, Shimadzu, and Agilent). First, we generated protein FASTA files and their protein digest maps. Second, the FASTA files were used to generate spectral libraries based on experimental data. Third, transition lists were derived from the spectral libraries using the vendor neutral and open Skyline software environment.

Many patients were potentially exposed to wildlife animals at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, where poultry, snake, bats, and other farm animals were also sold. To determine the possible virus reservoir, we have carried out comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on existing sequences of the newly identified coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Results obtained from our analyses suggest that the 2019-nCoV appears to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and an origin-unknown coronavirus. The recombination occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein, which recognizes cell surface receptor. Additionally, our findings suggest that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for the 2019-nCoV based on its RSCU bias resembling snake compared to other animals. Taken together, our results suggest that homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein may contribute to cross-species transmission from snake to humans.

Methods: The clinical data of 33 patients with respiratory symptoms caused by the novel coronavirus in Wenzhou city from January 15 to February 12,2020,were thoroughly reviewed. At the onset of the disease,we found that the primary symptoms were fever,cough,fatigue,chest tightness,chest pain and specific blood test results. According to the patients'histories,the patients were divided into two groups: those who spent time in the main epidemic area and those who did not spend time in the main epidemic area. The differences in the clinical manifestations between these two groups were analyzed. Results: The main clinical symptoms of patients infected with novel coronavirus in the secondary epidemic area were respiratory tract ailments and systemic symptoms. After grouping patients based on the presence or absence of residency in or travel history to the main epidemic area, there was no significant difference between the baseline data of these two groups, and there were no significant differences in symptoms and signs between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). Some patients had abnormally increased serum amyloid protein A (SAA). There were statistically significant differences in the leukocyte count/C-reactive protein,monocyte ratio/C-reactive protein,neutrophil count/C-reactive protein,monocyte count/C-reactive protein and hemoglobin/C-reactive protein values between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Respiratory tract ailments and systemic symptoms were the primary symptoms of novel coronavirus infection in the secondary epidemic area; these symptoms are not typical. The abnormal increase in serum amyloid protein (SAA) may be used as an auxiliary index for diagnosis and treatment. CRP changes before other blood parameters and thus may be an effective evaluation index for patients with COVID-19 infection.

Methods: Articles from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane database, and google up-to 24 February 2020 were systematically reviewed. Eighteen Literatures were identified with cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. The extracted data includes clinical symptoms, age, gender, sample size and region et al were systematic reviewed and meta analyzed. Results: 14 eligible studies including 1,424 patients were analyzed. Symptoms like fever (89.2%), cough (67.2%), fatigue (43.6%) were common, dizziness, hemoptysis, abdominal pain and conjunctival congestion/conjunctivitis were rare. Polypnea/dyspnea in severe patients were significantly higher than non-severe (42.7% vs.16.3%, P&lt;0.0001). Fever and diarrhea were higher in severe patients(p=0.0374and0.0267). Further meta-analysis showed incidence of fever(OR1.70,95%CI 1.01-2.87), polypnea/dyspnea(OR3.53, 95%CI 1.95-6.38) and diarrhea(OR1.80,95%CI 1.06-3.03) was higher in severe patients, which meant the severe risk of patients with fever, polypnea/dyspnea, diarrhea were 1.70, 3.53, 1.80 times higher than those with no corresponding symptoms. Conclusions: Fever, cough and fatigue are common symptoms in COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared with non-severe patients, the symptoms as fever, polypnea/dyspnea and diarrhea are potential symptoms lead to severity.

However, for human researchers studying the viruses and the hosts, the vast amount of information available cannot be processed effectively and in a timely manner, particularly when the scientific understanding may be limited, which can further lower the information processing efficiency. We present TWIRLS, a method that can automatically acquire, organize, and classify information. Additionally, independent functional data sources can be added to build an inference system using a machine-based approach, which can provide relevant knowledge to help human researchers quickly establish subject cognition and to make more effective decisions. TWIRLS can automatically analyze more than three million words in more than 14,000 literature articles in only 4 hours. Combining with generalized gene interaction databases creates a data interface that can help researchers to further analyze the information. Using the TWIRLS system, we found that an important regulatory factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may be involved in the host pathological changes on binding to the coronavirus after infection. After triggering functional changes in ACE2/AT2R, an imbalance in the steady-state cytokine regulatory axis involving the Renin-Angiotensin System and IP-10 leads to a cytokine storm.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jia, Lin</author><author>Li, Kewen</author><author>Jiang, Yu</author><author>Guo, Xin</author><author>zhao, Ting</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prediction and analysis of Coronavirus Disease 2019</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05447</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was found in a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China. WHO officially named this coronavirus as COVID-19. Since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12, 2019, China has reported a total of 78,824 confirmed CONID-19 cases and 2,788 deaths as of February 28, 2020. Wuhan's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths accounted for 61.1% and 76.5% of the whole China mainland , making it the priority center for epidemic prevention and control. Meanwhile, 51 countries and regions outside China have reported 4,879 confirmed cases and 79 deaths as of February 28, 2020. COVID-19 epidemic does great harm to people's daily life and country's economic development. This paper adopts three kinds of mathematical models, i.e., Logistic model, Bertalanffy model and Gompertz model. The epidemic trends of SARS were first fitted and analyzed in order to prove the validity of the existing mathematical models. The results were then used to fit and analyze the situation of COVID-19. The prediction results of three different mathematical models are different for different parameters and in different regions. In general, the fitting effect of Logistic model may be the best among the three models studied in this paper, while the fitting effect of Gompertz model may be better than Bertalanffy model. According to the current trend, based on the three models, the total number of people expected to be infected is 49852-57447 in Wuhan,12972-13405 in non-Hubei areas and 80261-85140 in China respectively. The total death toll is 2502-5108 in Wuhan, 107-125 in Non-Hubei areas and 3150-6286 in China respetively. COVID-19 will be over p robably in late-April, 2020 in Wuhan and before late-March, 2020 in other areas respectively.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jia, Wangping</author><author>Han, Ke</author><author>Song, Yang</author><author>Cao, Wenzhe</author><author>Wang, Shengshu</author><author>Yang, Shanshan</author><author>Wang, Jianwei</author><author>Kou, Fuyin</author><author>Tai, Penggang</author><author>Li, Jing</author><author>Liu, Miao</author><author>He, Yao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extended SIR prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in Italy and compared with Hunan, China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.18.20038570</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.18.20038570</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Jia et al. - 2020 - Extended SIR prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19 in Italy and compared with Hunan, China.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID19) is currently a global public health threat. Outside of China, Italy is one of the most suffering countries with the COVID19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemics trend of COVID19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. Methods: We used time series data of COVID 19 from Jan 22,2020 to Mar 16,2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible infected removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with similar total number of populations in Italy, was used as a comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for COVID 19 was respectively 4.10 (95% CI: 2.15 to 6.77) in Italy and 3.15(95% CI: 1.71 to 5.21) in Hunan. There would be totally 30 086 infected cases (95%CI:7920-81 869) under the current country blockade and the endpoint would be Apr 25 (95%CI: Mar 30 to Aug 07) in Italy. If the country blockade is imposed 5 day later, the total number of infected cases would expand the infection scale 1.50 times. Conclusion: Italy's current strict measures can efficaciously prevent the further spread of COVID19 and should be maintained. Necessary strict public health measures be implemented as soon as possible in other European countries with a high number of COVID19 cases. The most effective strategy needs to be confirmed in further studies. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement The study was funded by Army Logistics Emergency Scientific Research Project; Emergency scientific research of the army and the emergency scientific research of Chinese PLA General Hospital (20EP008). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Although several methods were performed in clinical practice, however, the IgM and IgG diagnostic value evaluation was little performed. 57 suspected COVID-19 infection patients were enrolled in our study. 24 patients with positive and 33 patients with negative nucleic acid test. The positive rate of COVID-19 nucleic acid was 42.10%. The positive detection rate of combination of IgM and IgG for patients with COVID-19 negative and positive nucleic acid test was 72.73% and 87.50%. The results were significantly higher than the nucleic acid or IgM, IgG single detection. hsCRP in the COVID-19 nucleic acid negative group showed significantly higher than the positive groups (P=0.0298). AST in the COVID-19 IgM negative group showed significantly lower than the positive groups (P=0.0365). We suggest a quick, simple, accurate aided detection method for the suspected patients and on-site screening in close contact with the population. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Clinical Trial This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University (NYSZYYEC20200009) ### Funding Statement No Funding supported this study ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Aiming to construct an efficient screening pattern, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of RT-PCR and chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19. Methods: The records including demographics, RT-PCR, and CT from 87 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 481 exclusion cases were collected. The diagnostic accuracy of the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR, CT, combination with the second pharyngeal swab RT-PCR or with CT were evaluated individually. Besides, all the stool RT-PCR results were plotted by time to explore the value of stool RT-PCR. Findings: Combination of RT-PCR and CT has the higher sensitivity (91.9%,79/86) than RT-PCR alone (78.2%，68/87) or CT alone (66.7%, 54 of 81) or combination of two RT-PCR tests (86.2%,75/87). There was good agreement between RT-PCR and CT (kappa-value, 0.430). In 34 COVID-19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20/32) showed positive RT-PCR. 46.7% (35/75) COVID-19 patients had at least one positive stool during the course. Two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. Importantly, one patient had consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs. Interpretation: Combination of RT-PCR and CT with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern to screen COVID-19. RT-PCR is superior to CT in diagnosing mild infections. Stool RT-PCR should be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and hospital discharge. This study shed light for optimizing scheme of screening and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We propose a time-varying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dyamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China over January 31 - February 19, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the influential inter-province routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, whereas the self-transmission in each province was accelerating over February 4-15. From February 16, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on February 18 and 19. Such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions, including the travel restrictions in Hubei. Implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial importance in provinces with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui) to controlling the spread of 2019-nCoV.

It is crucial to assess hospital environmental hygiene to understand the most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of 2019-nCoV in hospitals. Objective: To detect the presence of the COVID-19 in the air and on the surfaces of the guide station, fever clinic, and isolation areas, and the close contacts medical staffs in the First Hospital of Jilin University. Methods: Viruses in the air were collected by natural sedimentation and air particle sampler methods. Predetermined environmental surfaces were sampled using swabs at seven o'clock in the morning before disinfection. The samples from close contacts medical staffs were throat swab samples. Quantitative real-time PCR methods were used to confirm the existence of COVID-19 pathogens. Results: Viruses could be detected on the surfaces of the nurse station in the isolation area with suspected patients and in the air of the isolation ward with an intensive care patient. Conclusion: Comprehensive monitoring of hospital environmental hygiene during pandemic outbreaks is conducive to the refinement of hospital infection control. It is of great significance to ensure the safety of medical treatment and the quality of hospital infection control through the monitoring of environmental hygiene.

We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID-19 and SARS, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment. Methods: We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China. We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing city in early 2003. Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. The percentages of older age (≥65 years) were much higher in the deceased group than in the survived group in patients with both COVID-19 (83.8 vs. 13.2, P&lt;0.001) and SARS (37.4 vs. 4.9, P&lt;0.001). In the case series, men tend to be more serious than women (P=0.035), although age was comparable between men and women. In the public data set, age was also comparable between men and women in the deceased group or the survived group in patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, gender distribution was exactly symmetrical in the 1019 survivors of COVID-19. However, the percentage of male were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (70.3 vs. 50.0, P=0.015). The gender role in mortality was also observed in SARS patients. Survival analysis showed that men (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.47 [1.05-2.06, P= 0.025) had a significantly higher mortality rate than women in patients with SARS. Conclusion: Older age and male gender are risk factors for worse outcome in patients with COVID. While men and women have the same susceptibility to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, men may be more prone to have higher severity and mortality independent of age and susceptibility.

For it is a never been experienced respiratory disease before and with infection ability widely and quickly, it attracted the world's attention but without treatment and control manual. For the request from frontline clinicians and public health professionals of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia management, an evidence-based guideline urgently needs to be developed. Therefore, we drafted this guideline according to the rapid advice guidelines methodology and general rules of WHO guideline development; we also added the first-hand management data of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial infection prevention and control, and disease nursing of the 2019-nCoV. Moreover, we also provide a whole process of a successful treatment case of the severe 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia and experience and lessons of hospital rescue for 2019-nCoV infections. This rapid advice guideline is suitable for the first frontline doctors and nurses, managers of hospitals and healthcare sections, community residents, public health persons, relevant researchers, and all person who are interested in the 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jin, Zhenming</author><author>Du, Xiaoyu</author><author>Xu, Yechun</author><author>Deng, Yongqiang</author><author>Liu, Meiqin</author><author>Zhao, Yao</author><author>Zhang, Bing</author><author>Li, Xiaofeng</author><author>Zhang, Leike</author><author>Duan, Yinkai</author><author>Yu, Jing</author><author>Wang, Lin</author><author>Yang, Kailin</author><author>Liu, Fengjiang</author><author>You, Tian</author><author>Liu, Xiaoce Xiang</author><author>Yang, Xiuna</author><author>Bai, Fang</author><author>Liu, Hong</author><author>Liu, Xiaoce Xiang</author><author>Guddat, Luke W.</author><author>Xiao, Gengfu</author><author>Qin, Chengfeng</author><author>Shi, Zhengli</author><author>Jiang, Hualiang</author><author>Rao, Zihe</author><author>Yang, Haitao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Structure-based drug design, virtual screening and high-throughput screening rapidly identify antiviral leads targeting COVID-19</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.26.964882</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.26.964882</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Jin et al. - 2020 - Structure-based drug design, virtual screening and high-throughput screening rapidly identify antiviral leads target.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>A coronavirus identified as 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is the etiological agent responsible for the 2019-2020 viral pneumonia outbreak that commenced in Wuhan. Currently there is no targeted therapeutics and effective treatment options remain very limited. In order to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, we initiated a program of combined structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening, and high-throughput screening to identify new drug leads that target the COVID-19 main protease (Mpro). Mpro is a key coronavirus enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for this virus. Here, we identified a mechanism-based inhibitor, N3, by computer-aided drug design and subsequently determined the crystal structure of COVID-19 Mpro in complex with this compound. Next, through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed over 10,000 compounds including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and other pharmacologically active compounds as inhibitors of Mpro. Seven of these inhibit Mpro with IC50 values ranging from 0.48 to 16.62 μM. Ebselen, thiadiazolidinone-8 (TDZD-8) and N3 also exhibited strong antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening strategy, and establishes a new paradigm for the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases where no specific drugs or vaccines are available.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jing, Qin</author><author>You, Chong</author><author>Lin, Qiushi</author><author>Hu, Taojun</author><author>Yu, Shicheng</author><author>Zhou, Xiao-Hua</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimation of incubation period distribution of COVID-19 using disease onset forward time: a novel cross-sectional and forward follow-up study</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.06.20032417</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.06.20032417</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly spread across countries and become a global crisis. However, one of the most important clinical characteristics in epidemiology, the distribution of the incubation period, remains unclear. Different estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 were reported in recent published studies, but all have their own limitations. In this study, we propose a novel low-cost and accurate method to estimate the incubation distribution. Methods: We have conducted a cross-sectional and forward follow-up study by identifying those asymptomatic individuals at their time of departure from Wuhan and then following them until their symptoms developed. The renewal process is hence adopted by considering the incubation period as a renewal and the duration between departure and symptom onset as a forward recurrence time. Under mild assumptions, the observations of selected forward times can be used to consistently estimate the parameters in the distribution of the incubation period. Such a method enhances the accuracy of estimation by reducing recall bias and utilizing the abundant and readily available forward time data. Findings: The estimated distribution of forward time fits the observations in the collected data well. The estimated median of incubation period is 8.13 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.37-8.91), the mean is 8.62 days (95% CI: 8.02-9.28), the 90th percentile is 14.65 days (95% CI: 14.00-15.26), and the 99th percentile is 20.59 days (95% CI: 19.47, 21.62). Compared with results in other studies, the incubation period estimated in this study is longer. Interpretation: Based on the estimated incubation distribution in this study, about 10% of patients with COVID-19 would not develop symptoms until 14 days after infection. Further study of the incubation distribution is warranted to directly estimate the proportion with long incubation periods.

To develop broad spectrum anti-viral agents, we further describe a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3’-blocking groups that we have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as polymerase terminators.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ju, Jingyue</author><author>Li, Xiaoxu</author><author>Kumar, Shiv</author><author>Jockusch, Steffen</author><author>Chien, Minchen</author><author>Tao, Chuanjuan</author><author>Morozova, Irina</author><author>Kalachikov, Sergey</author><author>Kirchdoerfer, Robert</author><author>Russo, James J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nucleotide Analogues as Inhibitors of SARS-CoV Polymerase</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.12.989186</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.12.989186</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;not added;reviewed</label><abstract>SARS-CoV-2, a member of the coronavirus family, has caused a global public health emergency. Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously reasoned that the FDA-approved heptatitis C drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) should inhibit coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Here, using model polymerase extension experiments, we demonstrate that the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is incorporated by low-fidelity polymerases and SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and blocks further incorporation by these polymerases; the activated triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir is not incorporated by a host-like high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Using the same molecular insight, we selected two other anti-viral agents, Alovudine and AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV RdRp. We demonstrate the ability of two HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 3′-fluoro-3′-deoxythymidine triphosphate and 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine triphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine and AZT), to be incorporated by SARS-CoV RdRp where they also terminate further polymerase extension. Given the 98% amino acid similarity of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps, we expect these nucleotide analogues would also inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase. These results offer guidance to further modify these nucleotide analogues to generate more potent broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus agents.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jung, Sung-mok</author><author>Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R</author><author>Hayashi, Katsuma</author><author>Linton, Natalie M</author><author>Yang, Yichi</author><author>Yuan, Baoyin</author><author>Kobayashi, Tetsuro</author><author>Kinoshita, Ryo</author><author>Nishiura, Hiroshi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Real time estimation of the risk of death from novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection: Inference using exported cases</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.29.20019547</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.29.20019547</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://medrxiv.org/content/early/2020/02/02/2020.01.29.20019547.abstract</url><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/02/2020.01.29.20019547.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>The exported cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection who were confirmed in other countries provide a chance to estimate the cumulative incidence and confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) in China. Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV in the early stage of epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number, i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a naive population. As of 24 January 2020, with 23 exported cases, and estimating the growth rate from 8 December 2019 (scenario 1) and using the data since growth of exported cases (scenario 2), the cumulative incidence in China was estimated at 5433 cases (95% confidence interval (CI): 3883, 7160) and 17780 cases (95% CI: 9646, 28724), respectively. The latest estimates of the cCFR were 4.6% (95% CI: 3.1-6.6) for scenario 1 and 7.7% (95% CI: 4.9-11.3%) for scenario 2, respectively. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI: 2.1, 2.3) and 3.7 (95% CI: 3.1, 4.3) for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on the results, we note that current 2019-nCoV epidemic has a substation potential to cause a pandemic.

Knowledge of the cCFR is critical to characterize the severity and understand the pandemic potential of COVID-19 in the early stage of the epidemic. Using the exponential growth rate of the incidence, the present study statistically estimated the cCFR and the basic reproduction number&amp;mdash;the average number of secondary cases generated by a single primary case in a na&amp;iuml;ve population. We modeled epidemic growth either from a single index case with illness onset on 8 December, 2019 (Scenario 1), or using the growth rate fitted along with the other parameters (Scenario 2) based on data from 20 exported cases reported by 24 January 2020. The cumulative incidence in China by 24 January was estimated at 6924 cases (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4885, 9211) and 19,289 cases (95% CI: 10,901, 30,158), respectively. The latest estimated values of the cCFR were 5.3% (95% CI: 3.5%, 7.5%) for Scenario 1 and 8.4% (95% CI: 5.3%, 12.3%) for Scenario 2. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 2.1 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.2) and 3.2 (95% CI: 2.7, 3.7) for Scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Based on these results, we argued that the current COVID-19 epidemic has a substantial potential for causing a pandemic. The proposed approach provides insights in early risk assessment using publicly available data.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jung, Sung-mok</author><author>Kinoshita, Ryo</author><author>Thompson, Robin N</author><author>Hayashi, Katsuma</author><author>Linton, Natalie M</author><author>Yang, Yichi</author><author>Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R</author><author>Nishiura, Hiroshi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological identification of a novel infectious disease in real time: Analysis of the atypical pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, 2019-20</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.26.20018887</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.26.20018887</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/03/2020.01.26.20018887.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Objective: Virological tests indicate that a novel coronavirus is the most likely explanation for the 2019-20 pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China. We demonstrate that non-virological descriptive characteristics could have determined that the outbreak is caused by a novel pathogen in advance of virological testing. Methods: Characteristics of the ongoing outbreak were collected in real time from two medical social media sites. These were compared against characteristics of ten existing pathogens that can induce atypical pneumonia. The probability that the current outbreak is due to &quot;Disease X&quot; (i.e., previously unknown etiology) as opposed to one of the known pathogens was inferred, and this estimate was updated as the outbreak continued. Results: The probability that Disease X is driving the outbreak was assessed as over 32% on 31 December 2019, one week before virus identification. After some specific pathogens were ruled out by laboratory tests on 5 Jan 2020, the inferred probability of Disease X was over 59%. Conclusions: We showed quantitatively that the emerging outbreak of atypical pneumonia cases is consistent with causation by a novel pathogen. The proposed approach, that uses only routinely-observed non-virological data, can aid ongoing risk assessments even before virological test results become available.

Characteristics of the ongoing outbreak were collected in real time from two medical social media sites.

The probability that the current outbreak is due to “Disease X” (i.e., previously unknown etiology) as opposed to one of the known pathogens was inferred, and this estimate was updated as the outbreak continued. The probability (expressed as a percentage) that Disease X is driving the outbreak was assessed as over 29% on 31 December 2019, one week before virus identification.

Within two months of the outbreak, more than 80,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide. Since the human to human transmission occurred easily and the human infection is rapidly increasing, the sensitive and early diagnosis is essential to prevent the global outbreak. Recently, World Health Organization (WHO) announced various primer and probe sets for SARS-CoV-2 previously developed in China, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, and USA. In this study, we compared the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA among the seven primer-probe sets for N gene and the three primer-probe sets for Orf1 gene. The result of the comparative analysis represented that the 2019-nCoV\_N2, N3 of USA and the ORF1ab of China are the most sensitive primer-probe sets for N and Orf1 genes, respectively. Therefore, the appropriate combination from ORF1ab (China), 2019-nCoV\_N2, N3 (USA), and NIID\_2019-nCOV\_N (Japan) sets should be selected for the sensitive and reliable laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kakimoto, Kensaku</author><author>Kamiya, Hajime</author><author>Yamagishi, Takuya</author><author>Matsui, Tamano</author><author>Suzuki, Motoi</author><author>Wakita, Takaji</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Initial Investigation of Transmission of COVID-19 Among Crew Members During Quarantine of a Cruise Ship - Yokohama, Japan, February 2020.</title><secondary-title>MMWR.

On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of 2019-nCoV in humans was reported in Wuhan, China. We analyzed data from field investigations and genetic sequencing to provide evidence of human-to-human transmission. Methods: A confirmed case of 2019-nCoV was defined if a suspected case was verified with positive of 2019-nCoV in throat swabs, nasal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), or endotracheal aspirates by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) or genetic sequencing. Field investigations were conducted for each confirmed case. Clinical and demographic data of the confirmed cases were collected from their medical records. Exposure and travel histories were obtained by interviewing the confirmed cases. Results: Seventeen confirmed cases were identified from January 1 to 21, 2020 in Guangdong Province, China. Of them, two cases (11.8%) arisen locally without travel history to Wuhan or exposure history to wildlife market within 14 days prior to the onset of illness. These two cases were from two family cluster infections including 4 and 2 index cases, respectively. The whole viral genome from the two cases was exactly the same with their index cases, and presented a few unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) which were predicted to cause one amino acid change in spike protein and Orf8 protein, respectively. Conclusions: This study identified two human-to-human transmitted cases of 2019-nCoV in Guangdong Province, China, which indicates that prevention strategies of cutting the person-to-person transmission of 2019-nCoV in households, hospitals and communities are urgently implemented.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFA0606200, 2018YFA0606202), the Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province (2018B020207006, 2019B020208005, 2019B111103001), Guangzhou Science and technology Plan Project (201804010383).Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

It is currently no specific viral protein targeted therapeutics yet. Viral nucleocapsid protein is a potential antiviral drug target, serving multiple critical functions during the viral life cycle. However, the structural information of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is yet to be clear. Herein, we have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal RNA binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Although overall structure is similar with other reported coronavirus nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, the surface electrostatic potential characteristics between them are distinct. Further comparison with mild virus type HCoV-OC43 equivalent domain demonstrates a unique potential RNA binding pocket alongside the beta-sheet core. Complemented by in vitro binding studies, our data provide several atomic resolution features of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain, guiding the design of novel antiviral agents specific targeting to SARS-CoV-2.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kanne, Jeffrey P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chest CT Findings in 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infections from Wuhan, China: Key Points for the Radiologist</title><secondary-title>Radiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Radiology</full-title></periodical><pages>200241</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><accession-num>32017662</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1148/radiol.2020200241</electronic-resource-num><notes>32017662[pmid]</notes><research-notes>32017662[pmid]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32017662</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karako, Kenji</author><author>Song, Peipei</author><author>Chen, Yu</author><author>Tang, Wei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of COVID-19 infection spread in Japan based on stochastic transition model.</title><secondary-title>Bioscience trends</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bioscience trends</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Biosci Trends</publisher><accession-num>32188819</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.5582/bst.2020.01482</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32188819</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>To assess the effectiveness of response strategies of avoiding large gatherings or crowded areas and to predict the spread of COVID-19 infections in Japan, we developed a stochastic transmission model by extending the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemiological model with an additional modeling of the individual action on whether to stay away from the crowded areas. The population were divided into three compartments: Susceptible, Infected, Removed. Susceptible transitions to Infected every hour with a probability determined by the ratio of Infected and the congestion of area. The total area consists of three zones crowded zone, mid zone and uncrowded zone, with different infection probabilities characterized by the number of people gathered there. The time for each people to spend in the crowded zone is curtailed by 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 hours, and the time spent in mid zone is extended accordingly. This simulation showed that the number of Infected and Removed will increase rapidly if there is no reduction of the time spent in crowded zone. On the other hand, the stagnant growth of Infected can be observed when the time spent in the crowded zone is reduced to 4 hours, and the growth number of Infected will decrease and the spread of the infection will subside gradually if the time spent in the crowded zone is further cut to 2 hours. In conclusions The infection spread in Japan will be gradually contained by reducing the time spent in the crowded zone to less than 4 hours.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Keeling, Matt J</author><author>Hollingsworth, T.

Importation of novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) from China and elsewhere into the United Kingdom highlights the need to understand the impact of contact tracing as a control measure. Using detailed survey information on social encounters coupled to predictive models, we investigate the likely efficacy of the current UK definition of a close contact (within 2 meters for 15 minutes or more) and the distribution of secondary cases that may go untraced. Taking recent estimates for COVID-19 transmission, we show that less than 1 in 5 cases will generate any subsequent untraced cases, although this comes at a high logistical burden with an average of 36.1 individuals (95th percentiles 0-182) traced per case. Changes to the definition of a close contact can reduce this burden, but with increased risk of untraced cases; we estimate that any definition where close contact requires more than 4 hours of contact is likely to lead to uncontrolled spread.

COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take more than a year to develop a vaccine, our best short term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called -1 PRF to control the relative expression of their proteins. Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it utilizes a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 PRF, that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural analyses reveal that the core -1 PRF signal, composed of the U UUA AAC slippery site and three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot is highly conserved. In contrast, the upstream attenuator hairpin is less well conserved. Functional assays revealed that both elements promote similar rates of -1 PRF and that silent coding mutations in the slippery site strongly ablate -1 PRF activity. We suggest that molecules that were previously identified as inhibiting SARS-CoV mediated -1 PRF may serve as lead compounds to counter the current pandemic.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ki, Moran</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiologic characteristics of early cases with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) disease in Republic of Korea</title><secondary-title>Epidemiology and Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Epidemiology and Health</full-title></periodical><pages>e2020007</pages><keywords><keyword>Epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Isolation</keyword><keyword>Outbreak</keyword><keyword>Quarantine</keyword><keyword>Republic of Korea</keyword><keyword>novel Coronavirus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32035431</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.4178/epih.e2020007</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Ki - Unknown - Epidemiologic characteristics of early cases with 2019-nCoV disease in Republ.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32035431</url><url>http://e-epih.org/journal/view.php?doi=10.4178/epih.e2020007</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Since the first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in South Korea was confirmed on January 20, 2020, there have been 24 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV. The majority of these cases (58.3%; n=14) were male, with a median age of 42 years (range, 21-62 years). Of the confirmed cases, 15 were index cases (63%), six were first-generation patients (24%), and three were second-generation patients (12.5%). All the first- and second-generation patients were family members or close acquaintances of index cases. All the index cases entered the South Korea from January 19 to 24, 2020. The average incubation period was 3.6 days (median, 4 days) and the reproduction number (R0) was calculated as 0.5. Two of the confirmed cases were asymptomatic. As of February 8, 22 patients with 2019-nCoV are hospitalized in South Korea, and 2 have been discharged from the hospital. The epidemiological indicators will be revised as new information becomes available in the future. Sharing epidemiological information among researchers around the world is essential for efficient preparations and responses to new infectious diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Dongwan</author><author>Lee, Joo-Yeon</author><author>Yang, Jeong-Sun</author><author>Kim, Jun Won</author><author>Kim, V.

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 was reported recently, but its transcriptomic architecture is unknown. Utilizing two complementary sequencing techniques, we here present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. In addition to the genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 produces a large number of transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif being AAGAA. Modified RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the internal modification and the 3′ tail. Functional investigation of the unknown ORFs and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Jin Yong</author><author>Choe, Pyoeng Gyun</author><author>Oh, Yoonju</author><author>Oh, Kyung Joong</author><author>Kim, Jinsil</author><author>Park, So Jeong</author><author>Park, Ji Hye</author><author>Na, Hye Kyoung</author><author>Oh, Myoung Don</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Imported into Korea from Wuhan, China: Implication for Infection Prevention and Control Measures</title><secondary-title>Journal of Korean medical science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Korean medical science</full-title></periodical><pages>e61-e61</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>Coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Outbreak</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia</keyword><keyword>Radiography</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>Korea (South)</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e61</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32030925</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>In December 2019, a viral pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), began in Wuhan, China.

These dynamics will depend on seasonality, the duration of immunity, and the strength of cross-immunity to/from the other human coronaviruses. Using data from the United States, we measured how these factors affect transmission of human betacoronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. We then built a mathematical model to simulate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the year 2025. We project that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after an initial pandemic wave. We summarize the full range of plausible transmission scenarios and identify key data still needed to distinguish between them, most importantly longitudinal serological studies to determine the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.

The amount of social distancing needed to curb the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the context of seasonally varying transmission remains unclear. Using a mathematical model, we assessed that one-time interventions will be insufficient to maintain COVID-19 prevalence within the critical care capacity of the United States. Seasonal variation in transmission will facilitate epidemic control during the summer months but could lead to an intense resurgence in the autumn. Intermittent distancing measures can maintain control of the epidemic, but without other interventions, these measures may be necessary into 2022. Increasing critical care capacity could reduce the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic while ensuring that critically ill patients receive appropriate care.

Age-specific social mixing is often inferred from surveys of self-recorded contacts which by design often have a very limited number of participants. In addition, such surveys are rare, so public health interventions are often evaluated by considering only one such study. Here we report detailed population contact patterns for United Kingdom based self-reported contact data from over 36,000 volunteers that participated in the massive citizen science project BBC Pandemic. The amount of data collected allows us generate fine-scale age-specific population contact matrices by context (home, work, school, other) and type (conversational or physical) of contact that took place. These matrices are highly relevant for informing prevention and control of new outbreaks, and evaluating strategies that reduce the amount of mixing in the population (such as school closures, social distancing, or working from home). In addition, they finally provide the possibility to use multiple sources of social mixing data to evaluate the uncertainty that stems from social mixing when designing public health interventions.

To date, despite various strategies to identify CoV interventions, there are only limited therapeutic options available. To address these unmet medical needs, we used a South Korean MERS-CoV clinical isolate and screened 5,406 compounds, including US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs and bioactive molecules, confirmed 221 hits by dose-response curve analysis in the primary assay, and selected 54 hits with a therapeutic index (TI) greater than 6. Time-of-addition studies with 12 FDA-approved drugs demonstrated that eight and four therapeutics act on the early- and late stages of the viral life cycle, respectively. Among the early acting drugs, three therapeutics with a TI greater than 100 were cardiotonic agents. Together, our results identify potential therapeutic options for treatment of MERS-CoV infections and could provide a basis for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kobayashi, Tetsuro</author><author>Jung, Sung-mok</author><author>Linton, Natalie M.</author><author>Kinoshita, Ryo</author><author>Hayashi, Katsuma</author><author>Miyama, Takeshi</author><author>Anzai, Asami</author><author>Yang, Yichi</author><author>Yuan, Baoyin</author><author>Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.</author><author>Suzuki, Ayako</author><author>Nishiura, Hiroshi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Communicating the Risk of Death from Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>580</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>J Clin Med</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/jcm9020580</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/2/580</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>&lt;p&gt;To understand the severity of infection for a given disease, it is common epidemiological practice to estimate the case fatality risk, defined as the risk of death among cases. However, there are three technical obstacles that should be addressed to appropriately measure this risk. First, division of the cumulative number of deaths by that of cases tends to underestimate the actual risk because deaths that will occur have not yet observed, and so the delay in time from illness onset to death must be addressed. Second, the observed dataset of reported cases represents only a proportion of all infected individuals and there can be a substantial number of asymptomatic and mildly infected individuals who are never diagnosed. Third, ascertainment bias and risk of death among all those infected would be smaller when estimated using shorter virus detection windows and less sensitive diagnostic laboratory tests. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from COVID-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems. Although COVID-19 involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with underlying comorbidities require additional care.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kochanczyk, Marek</author><author>Grabowski, Frederic</author><author>Lipniacki, Tomasz</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of the contact and exclusion rates on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.13.20035485</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.13.20035485</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>In March 2020, Coronavirus Disease 2019 originating from Wuhan, China, has become pandemic. Based on epidemic data from China we constructed and constrained a simple Susceptible-Infected-Infectious-Excluded (SIIE) model. The model is characterized by only three parameters: average incubation period, contact rate rC, and exclusion rate rE. These two rates control the daily multiplication coefficient β describing epidemic growth in its early exponential phase, during which the number of excluded (confirmed) individuals grows as E = E exp(α,t) with α = lnβ. The rates can be modified by non-therapeutic interventions: rC can be reduced by quarantine, while rE can be increased by efficient testing, enabling isolation of infectious individuals. In order to contain exponential epidemic growth, quotient rC/rE has to be reduced to 1. Based on the model, we estimate that the quarantine imposed in China on January 23, 2020 resulted in about 50-fold reduction of this quotient, allowing to terminate the exponential growth phase and enter the phase of exponential regression of daily new cases. In contrast, quarantine imposed in northern, most affected, Italian provinces on February 21 resulted in about 3-fold reduction of rC/rE and corresponding decrease of β from about 1.5 to about 1.2; further 5-fold reduction is necessary to terminate exponential growth. Even higher reduction should take place in France, Germany and Spain for which β &gt; 1.3 (as of March 10, 2020). Considering longer-term dynamics in the case when the initial exponential growth is not contained by quarantine, we analyzed a scenario in which rE decreases in response to the surge of daily new cases which convinces people to isolate themselves. In such case, initial abrupt epidemic growth is followed by a slow decrease over years. This scenario, although economically and socially devastating, grants time to develop, produce, and distribute vaccine.

Major behavioral, clinical, and state interventions are underway currently to mitigate the epidemic and prevent the persistence of the virus in human populations in China and worldwide. It remains unclear how these unprecedented interventions, including travel restrictions, have affected COVID-19 spread in China. We use real-time mobility data from Wuhan and detailed case data including travel history to elucidate the role of case importation on transmission in cities across China and ascertain the impact of control measures. Early on, the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases in China was well explained by human mobility data. Following the implementation of control measures, this correlation dropped and growth rates became negative in most locations, although shifts in the demographics of reported cases are still indicative of local chains of transmission outside Wuhan. This study shows that the drastic control measures implemented in China have substantially mitigated the spread of COVID-19.

Methods: We evaluated whether and under which conditions it is possible to control and slow down a COVID-19 epidemic in the early stages by isolation and contact tracing. We used a stochastic transmission model in which every person generates novel infections according to a probability distribution that is affected by the incubation period distribution (time from infection to symptoms), distribution of the latent period (time from infection to a person becoming infectious), and overall transmissibility. The model distinguishes between close contacts (e.g., within a household) and other contacts in the population. Findings: The analyses showed that transmissibility and the duration of the latent period relative to the duration of incubation period have strong impact on the controllability of the disease. Delays in diagnosis of cases and proportion of asymptomatic cases are key factors for containment and slowing down the epidemic. Interpretation: Isolation and contact tracing can be an effective means to control early epidemics, but only if transmissibility as measured by R0 is in the lower ranges of reported values. Timeliness as well as completeness of tracing and diagnosis of cases are paramount to achieve containment and effective slowing down of the epidemic growth rate.

Coronavirus is interspecies and can also be transmitted from man to man, with an incubation ranging from 1 to 14 days. Human coronavirus infections can induce not only mild to severe respiratory diseases, but also inflammation, high fever, cough, acute respiratory tract infection and dysfunction of internal organs that may lead to death. Coronavirus infection (regardless of the various types of corona virus) is primarily attacked by immune cells including mast cells (MCs), which are located in the submucosa of the respiratory tract and in the nasal cavity and represent a barrier of protection against microorganisms. Viral activate MCs release early inflammatory chemical compounds including histamine and protease; while late activation provokes the generation of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members including IL-1, IL-6 and IL-33. Here, we propose for the first time that inflammation by coronavirus may be inhibited by anti-inflammatory cytokines belonging to the IL-1 family members.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kruse, Robert L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Therapeutic strategies in an outbreak scenario to treat the novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China</title><secondary-title>F1000Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>F1000Research</full-title></periodical><pages>72</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Faculty of 1000 Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.12688/f1000research.22211.1</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in Wuhan, China presents a potential respiratory viral pandemic to the world population. Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain, providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken. Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kucharski, Adam J</author><author>Russell, Timothy W</author><author>Diamond, Charlie</author><author>Group, CMMID nCoV working</author><author>Funk, Sebastian</author><author>Eggo, Rosalind M</author><author>Group, CMMID nCoV working</author><author>Funk, Sebastian</author><author>Eggo, Rosalind M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Early dynamics of transmission and control of 2019-nCoV: a mathematical modelling study</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.31.20019901</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.31.20019901</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Kucharski et al. - 2020 - Early dynamics of transmission and control of 2019-nCoV a mathematical modelling study(2).pdf</url><url>internal-pdf://Kucharski et al. - 2020 - Early dynamics of transmission and control of 2019-nCoV a mathematical modelling study.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/02/2020.01.31.20019901.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to 46,997 confirmed cases as of 13th February 2020. Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Methods: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. Findings: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number, Rt , declined from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd January to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) one week after. Based on our estimates of Rt,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Interpretation: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission likely declined in Wuhan during late January 2020, coinciding with the introduction of control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan pre-control, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but may still cause new outbreaks eventually. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (grants 206250/Z/17/Z and 210758/Z/18/Z) and HDR UK (grant: MR/S003975/1). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

This study aims to investigate its epidemiologic history, and analyzed the clinical characteristics, treatment regimens, and prognosis of patients infected with 2019-nCoV during this outbreak. METHODS Clinical data from 137 2019-nCoV-infected patients admitted to the respiratory departments of nine tertiary hospitals in Hubei province from December 30, 2019 to January 24, 2020 were collected, including general status, clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, imaging characteristics, and treatment regimens. RESULTS None of the 137 patients (61 males, 76 females, aged 20-83 years, mean age 55 ± 16 years) had a definite history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. Major initial symptoms included fever (112/137, 81.8%), coughing (66/137, 48.2%), and muscle pain or fatigue (44/137, 32.1%), with other, less typical initial symptoms observed at low frequency, including heart palpitations, diarrhea, and headache. Nearly 80% of the patients had normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% (99/137) had lymphocytopenia. Lung involvement was present in all cases, with most chest computed tomography scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which were dense; ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows. Given the lack of effective drugs, treatment focused on symptomatic and respiratory support. Immunoglobulin G was delivered to some critically ill patients according to their condition. Systemic corticosteroid treatment did not show significant benefits. Notably, early respiratory support facilitated disease recovery and improved prognosis. The risk of death was primarily associated with age, underlying chronic diseases, and median interval from the appearance of initial symptoms to dyspnea. CONCLUSIONS The majority of patients with 2019-nCoV coronavirus pneumonia present with fever as the first symptom, and most of them still showed typical manifestations of viral pneumonia on chest imaging. Middle-aged and elderly patients with underlying comorbidities are susceptible to respiratory failure and may have a poorer prognosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kujawski, Stephanie A.</author><author>Wong, Karen K</author><author>Collins, Jennifer P.</author><author>Epstein, Lauren</author><author>Killerby, Marie E.</author><author>Midgley, Claire M.</author><author>Abedi, Glen R.</author><author>Ahmed, N.

More than 93,000 cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported worldwide. We describe the epidemiology, clinical course, and virologic characteristics of the first 12 U.S. patients with COVID-19. Methods: We collected demographic, exposure, and clinical information from 12 patients confirmed by CDC during January 20-February 5, 2020 to have COVID-19. Respiratory, stool, serum, and urine specimens were submitted for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR testing, virus culture, and whole genome sequencing. Results: Among the 12 patients, median age was 53 years (range: 21-68); 8 were male, 10 had traveled to China, and two were contacts of patients in this series. Commonly reported signs and symptoms at illness onset were fever (n=7) and cough (n=8). Seven patients were hospitalized with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and demonstrated clinical or laboratory signs of worsening during the second week of illness. Three were treated with the investigational antiviral remdesivir. All patients had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in respiratory specimens, typically for 2-3 weeks after illness onset, with lowest rRT-PCR Ct values often detected in the first week. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected after reported symptom resolution in seven patients. SARS-CoV-2 was cultured from respiratory specimens, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in stool from 7/10 patients. Conclusions: In 12 patients with mild to moderately severe illness, SARS-CoV-2 RNA and viable virus were detected early, and prolonged RNA detection suggests the window for diagnosis is long. Hospitalized patients showed signs of worsening in the second week after illness onset.

The purpose of this study is to give a prediction of the epidemic peak for COVID-19 in Japan by using the real-time data from 15 January to 29 February 2020. Taking into account the uncertainty due to the incomplete identification of infective population, we apply the well-known SEIR compartmental model for the prediction. By using a least-square-based method with Poisson noise, we estimate that the basic reproduction number for the epidemic in Japan is R 0 = 2 . 6 ( 95 % CI, 2 . 4 - 2 . 8 ) and the epidemic peak could possibly reach the early-middle summer. In addition, we obtain the following epidemiological insights: (1) the essential epidemic size is less likely to be affected by the rate of identification of the actual infective population; (2) the intervention has a positive effect on the delay of the epidemic peak; (3) intervention over a relatively long period is needed to effectively reduce the final epidemic size.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kwok, Kin On</author><author>Li, Kin Kit</author><author>Chan, Ho Hin</author><author>Yi, Yuan Yuan</author><author>Tang, Arthur</author><author>Wei, Wan In</author><author>Wong, Yeung Shan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Community responses during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong: risk perception, information exposure and preventive measures</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.26.20028217</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.26.20028217</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: Community responses are important for outbreak management during the early phase when non-pharmaceutical interventions are the major preventive options. Therefore, this study aims to examine the psychological and behavioral responses of the community during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hong Kong. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was launched within 36 hours after confirmed COVID-19 cases were first reported. Councilors of all 452 district council constituency areas were approached for survey dissemination. Respondent demographics, anxiety level, risk perception, sources to retrieve COVID-19 information, actual adoption and perceived efficacy of precautionary measures were collected. Result: Analysis from 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The anxiety level, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). Nearly all respondents were alert to the disease progression (99.5%). The most trusted information sources were doctors (84%), followed by broadcast (57%) and newspaper (54%), but they were not common information sources (doctor: 5%; broadcast: 34%; newspaper: 40%). Only 16% respondents found official websites reliable. Enhanced personal hygiene practices and travel avoidance to China were frequently adopted (&gt;77%) and considered effective (&gt;90%). The adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39%-88%), and their drivers for greater adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.27), living in the New Territories (aOR:1.32-1.55), perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 (aOR:1.84) and being more anxious (aOR:1.07). Discussion: Risk perception towards COVID-19 in the community was high. Most respondents are alert to the disease progression, and adopt self-protective measures. This study contributes by examining the psycho-behavioral responses of hosts, in addition to the largely studied mechanistic aspects, during the early phase of the current COVID-19 epidemic. The timely psychological and behavioral assessment of the community is useful to inform subsequent interventions and risk communication strategies as the epidemic progresses.

The scenario of the simulation is depicted based on the patient zero in Malaysia. The transmission model is found to be able to predict the next confirmed case given a single case introduced in a fully susceptible population. The mathematical model is developed based on the SEIR model which has susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered populations. The system of equations which were obtained were solved numerically and the simulation results were analyzed. The analysis includes the impact of the disease if no control is taken.

The two models used to estimate the reproduction number (coalescent−based exponential growth and a birth−death skyline method) indicated an estimated mean evolutionary rate of 7.8 x 10−4 subs/site/year (range 1.1x10−4−15x10−4). The estimated R value was 2.6 (range 2.1−5.1), and increased from 0.8 to 2.4 in December 2019. The estimated mean doubling time of the epidemic was between 3.6 and 4.1 days. This study proves the usefulness of phylogeny in supporting the surveillance of emerging new infections even as the epidemic is growing.

Design: Travel network-based modelling study. Setting and participants: General population travelling from Wuhan and other high-risk cities in China. Main outcome measures: Based on de-identified and aggregated mobile phone data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports, we defined the relative importation risk and internal and international destinations of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan and other high-risk cities in China. Results: The cordon sanitaire of Wuhan is likely to have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving the city before Lunar New Year (LNY), with travellers departing into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China, and a high proportion of cases likely travelled with symptoms at the early stage of the outbreak. Should secondary outbreaks occur in 17 high-risk secondary cities, they could contribute to seeding the virus in other highly connected cities within and beyond China after the LNY holiday. We estimated that 59,912 air passengers, of which 834 (95% UI: 478 - 1349) had 2019-nCoV infection, travelled from Wuhan to 382 cities outside of mainland China during the two weeks prior to the lockdown of Wuhan. The majority of these cities were in Asia, but major hubs in Europe, the US and Australia were also prominent, with strong correlation seen between predicted importation risks and reported cases seen. Because significant spread has already occurred, a large number of airline travellers (3.3 million under the scenario of 75% travel reduction from normal volumes) may be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 to effectively limit spread beyond its current extent. Conclusion: Further spread of 2019-nCoV within China and international exportation is likely to occur. All countries, especially vulnerable regions, should be prepared for efforts to contain the 2019-nCoV infection. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This study was supported by the grants from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1134076); the European Union Horizon 2020 (MOOD 874850); the National Natural Science Fund of China (81773498, 71771213, 91846301); National Science and Technology Major Project of China (2016ZX10004222-009, 2018ZX10201001-010, 2018ZX10713001-007, 2017ZX10103009-005); Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader (18XD1400300); Hunan Science and Technology Plan Project (2017RS3040, 2018JJ1034).

Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World. Methods: We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. Historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from Baidu location-based service, were used to derive the intensity of travel restrictions and contact reductions across China. The model and outputs were validated using daily reported case numbers, with a series of sensitivity analyses conducted. Results: We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range [IQR] 76,776 - 164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020, and these were highly correlated (p&lt;0.001, R2=0.86) with reported incidence. Without NPIs, the number of COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (IQR: 44 - 94), with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. If NPIs could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in China, cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, together with significantly reducing the number of affected areas. However, if NPIs were conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks later, the number of cases could have shown a 3-fold, 7-fold, and 18-fold increase across China, respectively. Results also suggest that the social distancing intervention should be continued for the next few months in China to prevent case numbers increasing again after travel restrictions were lifted on February 17, 2020. Conclusion: The NPIs deployed in China appear to be effectively containing the COVID-19 outbreak, but the efficacy of the different interventions varied, with the early case detection and contact reduction being the most effective. Moreover, deploying the NPIs early is also important to prevent further spread. Early and integrated NPI strategies should be prepared, adopted and adjusted to minimize health, social and economic impacts in affected regions around the World.

Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World. Methods: We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak.

This outbreak has been tentatively associated with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of zoonotic infection. Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for 2019-nCoV, the identity of any intermediate host facilitating transfer to humans is unknown. Here, we report the identification of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin associated CoVs that belong to two sub-lineages of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses, including one very closely related to 2019-nCoV in the receptor-binding domain. The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to 2019-nCoV suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible intermediate hosts for this novel human virus and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lamb, Laura E</author><author>Bartolone, Sarah N</author><author>Ward, Elijah</author><author>Chancellor, Michael B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rapid Detection of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) by Reverse Transcription-Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.19.20025155</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.19.20025155</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Novel Corona virus (COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is an emerging global health concern that requires a rapid diagnostic test. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently the standard for COVID-19 detection; however, Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) may allow for faster and cheaper field based testing at point-of-risk. The objective of this study was to develop a rapid screening diagnostic test that could be completed in under 30 minutes. Simulated patient samples were generated by spiking serum, urine, saliva, oropharyngeal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs with a portion of the COVID-19 nucleic sequence. The samples were tested using RT-LAMP as well as by conventional qRT-PCR. Specificity of the RT-LAMP was evaluated by also testing against other related coronaviruses. RT-LAMP specifically detected COVID-19 in simulated patient samples. This test was performed in under 30 minutes. This approach could be used for monitoring of exposed individuals or potentially aid with screening efforts in the field and potential ports of entry.

Previous work has focused on developing supervised models, where ground truth data, in the form of historical syndromic surveillance reports, can be used to train machine learning models. However, no sufficient data -- in terms of accuracy and time span -- exist to apply such approaches for monitoring the emerging COVID-19 infectious disease pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, unsupervised, or semi-supervised solutions should be sought. Recent outcomes have shown that it is possible to transfer an online search based model for influenza-like illness from a source to a target country without using ground truth data for the target location. The transferred model's accuracy depends on choosing search queries and their corresponding weights wisely, via a transfer learning methodology, for the target location. In this work, we draw a parallel to previous findings and attempt to develop an unsupervised model for COVID-19 by: (i) carefully choosing search queries that refer to related symptoms as identified by Public Health England in the United Kingdom (UK), and (ii) weighting them based on their reported ratio of occurrence in people infected by COVID-19. Finally, understanding that online searches may be also driven by concern rather than infections, we devise a preliminary approach that aims to minimise this part of the signal by incorporating a news media signal in association with confirmed COVID-19 cases. Results are presented for the UK, England, United States of America, Canada, Australia, and Greece.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lan, Jun</author><author>Ge, Jiwan</author><author>Yu, Jinfang</author><author>Shan, Sisi</author><author>Zhou, Huan</author><author>Fan, Shilong</author><author>Zhang, Qi</author><author>Shi, Xuanling</author><author>Wang, Qisheng</author><author>Zhang, Linqi</author><author>Wang, Xinquan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Crystal structure of the 2019-nCoV spike receptor-binding domain bound with the ACE2 receptor</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.19.956235</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.19.956235</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>A novel and highly pathogenic coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused an outbreak in Wuhan city, Hubei province of China since December 2019, and soon spread nationwide and spilled over to other countries around the world. To better understand the initial step of infection at atomic-level, we determined the crystal structure of the 2019-nCoV spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) bound with the cell receptor ACE2 at 2.45 angstrom resolution. The overall ACE2-binding mode of the 2019-nCoV RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, which also utilizes ACE2 as the cell receptor. Structural analysis identified residues in 2019-nCoV RBD critical for ACE2 binding, and majority of which are either highly conserved or shared similar side chain properties with those in the SARS-CoV RBD. Such similarity in structure and sequence strongly argue for a convergent evolution between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV RBD for improved binding to ACE2 despite of being segregated in different genetic lineages in the betacoronavirus genus. The epitopes of two SARS-CoV antibodies targeting the RBD are also analyzed with the 2019-nCoV RBD, providing insights into future identification of cross-reactive antibodies.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lau, Hien</author><author>Khosrawipour, Veria</author><author>Kocbach, Piotr</author><author>Mikolajczyk, Agata</author><author>Schubert, Justyna</author><author>Bania, Jacek</author><author>Khosrawipour, Tanja</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The positive impact of lockdown in Wuhan on containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China</title><secondary-title>Journal of Travel Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Travel Medicine</full-title></periodical><volume>taaa037</volume><keywords><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>effective</keyword><keyword>measures</keyword><keyword>pandemic</keyword><keyword>spread</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><accession-num>32181488</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/jtm/taaa037/5808003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://academic.oup.com/jtm/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jtm/taaa037/5808003</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: With its epicenter in Wuhan, China, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Consequently, many countries have implemented flight restrictions to China. China itself has imposed a lockdown of the population of Wuhan as well as the entire Hubei province. However, whether these two enormous measures have led to significant changes in the spread of COVID-19 cases remains unclear. Methods: We analyzed available data on the development of confirmed domestic and international COVID-19 cases before and after lockdown measures. We evaluated the correlation of domestic air traffic to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and determined the growth curves of COVID-19 cases within China before and after lockdown as well as after changes in COVID-19 diagnostic criteria. Results: Our findings indicate a significant increase in doubling time from 2 days (95% Confidence Interval, CI): 1.9-2.6), to 4 days (95% CI: 3.5-4.3), after imposing lockdown. A further increase is detected after changing diagnostic and testing methodology to 19.3 (95% CI: 15.1-26.3), respectively. Moreover, the correlation between domestic air traffic and COVID-19 spread became weaker following lockdown (before lockdown: r=0.98, p&lt;0.05 vs. after lockdown: r=0.91, p=NS). Conclusions: A significantly decreased growth rate and increased doubling time of cases was observed, which is most likely due to Chinese lockdown measures. A more stringent confinement of people in high risk areas seem to have a potential to slow down the spread of COVID-19.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lauer, Stephen A</author><author>Grantz, Kyra H</author><author>Bi, Qifang</author><author>Jones, Forrest K</author><author>Zheng, Qulu</author><author>Meredith, Hannah R</author><author>Azman, Andrew S</author><author>Reich, Nicholas G</author><author>Lessler, Justin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Incubation Period of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) From Publicly Reported Confirmed Cases: Estimation and Application.</title><secondary-title>Annals of internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of internal medicine</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Ann Intern Med</publisher><accession-num>32150748</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.7326/M20-0504</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32150748</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;peer;reviewed</label><abstract>Background A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in China in December 2019. There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period for clinical disease (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]), which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Objective To estimate the length of the incubation period of COVID-19 and describe its public health implications. Design Pooled analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between 4 January 2020 and 24 February 2020. Setting News reports and press releases from 50 provinces, regions, and countries outside Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Participants Persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection outside Hubei province, China. Measurements Patient demographic characteristics and dates and times of possible exposure, symptom onset, fever onset, and hospitalization. Results There were 181 confirmed cases with identifiable exposure and symptom onset windows to estimate the incubation period of COVID-19. The median incubation period was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5 to 5.8 days), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 15.6 days) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 101 out of every 10 000 cases (99th percentile, 482) will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Limitation Publicly reported cases may overrepresent severe cases, the incubation period for which may differ from that of mild cases. Conclusion This work provides additional evidence for a median incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 5 days, similar to SARS.

There is limited support for many of its key epidemiologic features, including the incubation period, which has important implications for surveillance and control activities. Here, we use data from public reports of 101 confirmed cases in 38 provinces, regions, and countries outside of Wuhan (Hubei province, China) with identifiable exposure windows and known dates of symptom onset to estimate the incubation period of 2019-nCoV. We estimate the median incubation period of 2019-nCoV to be 5.2 days (95% CI 4.4-6.0), and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms will do so within 10.5 days (95% CI: 7.3, 15.3) of infection. These estimates imply that, under conservative assumptions, 64 out of every 10,000 cases will develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Whether this risk is acceptable depends on the underlying risk of infection and consequences of missed cases. The estimates presented here can be used to inform policy in multiple contexts based on these judgments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo external funding was provided for this work.Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

In this paper we look at the impact of a single short-term intervention on an epidemic. We see that if an intervention cannot be sustained long-term, it has the greatest impact if it is imposed once infection levels have become large enough that there is an appreciable number of infections present. For minimising the total number infected it should start close to the peak so that there is no rebound once the intervention is stopped, while to minimise the peak prevalence, it should start earlier, allowing two peaks of comparable size rather than one very large peak. In populations with distinct subgroups, synchronized interventions are less effective than targeting the interventions in each sub-population separately. We do not attempt to clearly determine what makes an intervention sustainable or not. We believe that is a policy question. If an intervention is sustainable, it should be kept in place. Our intent is to offer insight into how best to time an intervention whose impact on society is too great to maintain.

An ACE2 mutant with low catalytic activity was also used in the study. The fusion proteins were then characterized. Both fusion proteins has high affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV and exerted desired pharmacological properties. Moreover, fusion proteins potently neutralized SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV in vitro.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) due to novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) related infection (COVID-19) is characterized by severe ventilation perfusion mismatch leading to refractory hypoxemia. To date, there is no specific treatment available for 2019-nCoV. Nitric oxide is a selective pulmonary vasodilator gas used as a rescue therapy in refractory hypoxemia due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In has also shown in-vitro and clinical evidence that inhaled nitric oxide gas (iNO) has antiviral activity against other strains of coronavirus. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether inhaled NO improves oxygenation in patients with hypoxic SARS-CoV2. This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with 1:1 individual allocation. Patients will be blinded to the treatment. Methods and analysis. Intubated patients admitted to the intensive care unit with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe hypoxemia will be randomized to receive inhalation of NO (treatment group) or not (control group). Treatment will be stopped when patients are free from hypoxemia for more than 24 hours. The primary outcome evaluates levels of oxygenation between the two groups at 48 hours. Secondary outcomes include rate of survival rate at 28 and 90 days in the two groups, time to resolution of severe hypoxemia, time to achieve negativity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests. Ethics and dissemination. The study protocol has been approved by the Investigational Review Board of Xijing Hospital (Xian, China) and pending the Partners Human Research Committee (Boston, USA). Recruitment will start after approval of both IRBs and local IRBs at other enrolling centers. Results of this study will be published in scientific journals, presented at scientific meetings, reported through flyers and posters, and published on related website or media in combating against this widespread contagious diseases.

Since SARS- CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these novel viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent 2019-nCoV, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leung, Char</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating the distribution of the incubation period of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection between travelers to Hubei, China and non-travelers</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.13.20022822</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.13.20022822</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Objectives: Amid the continuing spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the incubation period of COVID-19 should be regularly re-assessed as more information is available upon the increase in reported cases. The present work estimated the distribution of incubation periods of patients infected in and outside Hubei province of China. Methods: Clinical data were collected from the individual cases reported by the media as they were not fully available on the official pages of the Chinese health authorities. MLE was used to estimate the distributions of the incubation period. Results: It was found that the incubation period of patients with no travel history to Hubei was longer and more volatile. Conclusion: It is recommended that the duration of quarantine should be extended to at least 3 weeks.

Among them, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive, claiming detection of about 5 copies of viruses. However, it has been reported that only 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by RT-PCR, probably due to loss or degradation of virus RNA in the sampling process, or even mutation of the virus genome. Therefore, developing highly sensitive methods is imperative to ensure robust detection capabilities. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodate various application settings, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based method comprised of 172 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrate its efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers. The assay produces clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allows for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. In addition, optional sequencing can provide further confirmation as well as phylogenetic information of the identified virus(es) for specific strain discrimination, which will be of paramount importance for surveillance purposes that represent a global health imperative. Finally, we also developed in parallel and tested a multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method that is amenable to detect SARS-CoV-2, with the additional benefit of its potential for uncovering mutational diversity and novel pathogens at low sequencing depth.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Chun</author><author>Yang, Yanling</author><author>Ren, Linzhu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genetic evolution analysis of 2019 novel coronavirus and coronavirus from other species</title><secondary-title>Infection, Genetics and Evolution</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Infection, Genetics and Evolution</full-title></periodical><pages>104285</pages><volume>82</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Infect Genet Evol</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104285</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567134820301167</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;not added;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Cuilian</author><author>Chen, Li Jia</author><author>Chen, Xueyu</author><author>Zhang, Mingzhi</author><author>Pang, Chi Pui</author><author>Chen, Haoyu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Retrospective analysis of the possibility of predicting the COVID-19 outbreak from Internet searches and social media data, China, 2020</title><secondary-title>Eurosurveillance</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Eurosurveillance</full-title></periodical><volume>25</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Euro Surveill</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2000199</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.10.2000199</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Dalin</author><author>Lv, Jun</author><author>Botwin, Gregory</author><author>Braun, Jonathan</author><author>Cao, Weihua</author><author>Li, Liming</author><author>McGovern, Dermot P.B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating the scale of COVID-19 Epidemic in the United States: Simulations Based on Air Traffic directly from Wuhan, China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.06.20031880</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.06.20031880</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has been characterized by rapid spread and unusually large case clusters. It is important to have an estimate of the current state of COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. to develop informed public health strategies. Methods: We estimated the potential scale of the COVID-19 epidemic (as of 03/01/2020) in the U.S. from cases imported directly from Wuhan area. We used simulations based on transmission dynamics parameters estimated from previous studies and air traffic data from Wuhan to the U.S and deliberately built our model based on conservative assumptions. Detection and quarantine of individual COVID-19 cases in the U.S before 03/01/2020 were also taken into account. We. A SEIR model was used to simulate the growth of the number of infected individuals in Wuhan area and in the U.S. Results: With the most likely model, we estimated that there would be 9,484 infected cases (90%CI 2,054-24,241) as of 03/01/2020 if no intervention procedure had been taken to reduce the transmissibility in unidentified cases. Assuming current preventive procedures have reduced 25% of the transmissibility in unidentified cases, the number of infected cases would be 1,043 (90%CI 107-2,474). Conclusion: Our research indicates that, as of 03/01/2020., it is likely that there are already thousands of individuals in the US infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our model is dynamic and is available to the research community to further evaluate as the situation becomes clearer.

Version 1 posted Feb 18 2020. *Preprint - not peer-reviewed* Since the 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) outbreaks in Wuhan, China, the cumulative number of confirmed cases is increasing every day, and a large number of populations all over the world are at risk. The traffic blockage and quarantine can alleviate the risk of the epidemic and the infections. Evaluating the efficacy of such actions is essential to inform policy makers and raise the public awareness of the importance of self-isolation and quarantine. We apply our Flow-SEIR model to estimate the number of infections as well as the evaluate the policy of traffic blockage and quarantine, based on the data of confirmed case and the migration in China. We define two factors related to traffic blockage and quarantine to estimate the efficacy of these two intervation measures. In our study, since the public are urged to stay at home and self-protective, the self-protection at home is also accounted as a part of quarantine. In the simulated results, the quarantine is very effective for epidemic control, when the quarantine factor ε is close to 1, all the population is isolated from others, the peak number of infections will decrease by 89.68%. And the traffic blockage is also effective, however, provincial level traffic blockage can only alleviate 21.06% - 22.38% of the peak number of the infections. For Hubei Province, if the quarantine is 1 week earlier, the peak number of infections will decrease by 24.26% - 25.33%, if the traffic blockage is one week earlier, the peak number of infections only decreased by 3.10% - 3.79%. For the other provinces outside Hubei, if the quarantine is one week of earlier, the peak number will decrease by 32.78% - 35.60%, if the traffic blockage is one week earlier, the peak number of infections will decrease by 15.30% - 16.70%. If there is one day in advance for urban blockage, about 3,600 people will eventually be reduced in the country. If there is one day of delay, about 1,800 people will finally be at risk. In general, the effect of quarantine is even stronger than the traffic blockage control. The fact should not be ignored that there are still a large number of population who are exposed to the SARS-COV-2 but not yet symptomatic. Those exposed population is not easy to be found and infect others who are closely contacting with. So the traffic blockage and quarantine should be continued for a long time util the epidemic is totally under control.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo funding supportAuthor DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

In the past few decades, newly evolved Coronaviruses have posed a global threat to public health. Immune response is essential to control and eliminate CoV infections, however, maladjusted immune responses may result in immunopathology and impaired pulmonary gas exchange. Gaining a deeper understanding of the interaction between Coronaviruses and the innate immune systems of the hosts may shed light on the development and persistence of inflammation in the lungs and hopefully can reduce the risk of lung inflammation caused by CoVs. In this review, we provide an update on CoV infections and relevant diseases, particularly the host defense against CoV-induced inflammation of lung tissue, as well as the role of the innate immune system in pathogenesis and clinical treatment.

However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. Methods: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. Results: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human-animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence. Policies and programmes existing in the communities provide opportunities for zoonotic risk mitigation. Conclusions: This study explored the relationship among zoonotic risk and human behaviour, environment and policies in rural communities in southern China. It identifies key behavioural risk factors that can be targeted for development of tailored risk-mitigation strategies to reduce the threat of novel zoonoses.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Jie</author><author>Li, Jun</author><author>Xie, Xiaoru</author><author>Cai, Xiaomei</author><author>Huang, Jian</author><author>Tian, Xuemei</author><author>Zhu, Hong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Game consumption and the 2019 novel coronavirus</title><secondary-title>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30063-3</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30063-3</url><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1473309920300633</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Jie</author><author>Li, Shilin</author><author>Cai, Yurui</author><author>Liu, Qin</author><author>Li, Xue</author><author>Zeng, Zhaoping</author><author>Chu, Yanpeng</author><author>Zhu, Fangcheng</author><author>Zeng, Fanxin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of 17 Hospitalized Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus Infections Outside Wuhan, China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.11.20022053</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.11.20022053</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>An increasing number of cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) infected with 2019-nCoV have been identified in Wuhan and other cities in China, since December 2019. We analyzed data on the 17 confirmed cases in Dazhou to provide the epidemiologic characteristics of NCP outside Wuhan. Among them, 12 patients were still quarantined in the hospital, 5 patients were discharged NCP patients according to the national standards. Compared with non-discharged NCP patients, the discharged NCP patients had younger ages. Moreover, discharged NCP patients had higher heart rate, lymphocytes levels and monocytes levels than non-discharged NCP patients on admission to the hospital. Notably, all of 17 patients had abnormal increased C-reactive protein levels, and 16 patients had abnormal computed tomography images. This study provided some information that younger age, higher lymphocytes levels and monocytes levels at the diagnoses of 2019-nCoV may contributed to faster recovery and better therapeutic outcome.

Methods: We retrospectively collected data of 47 patients diagnosed as severe type of COVID-19 from February 8 to 22, 2020, including demographics, illness history, physical examination, laboratory test, management, and compared differences between men and women. Results: Of the 47 patients, 28 (59.6%) were men. The median age was 62 years, and 30 (63.8%) had comorbidities. The initial symptoms were mainly fever (34 [72.3%]), cough (36 [76.6%]), myalgia (5 [10.6%]) and fatigue (7 [14.9%]). Procalcitonin level was higher in men than in women (0.08 vs. 0.04ng/ml, p=0.002). N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide increased in 16 (57.1%) men and 5 (26.3%) women (p=0.037). Five men (17.9%) had detected positive influenza A antibody, but no women. During 2-week admission, 5 (17.9%) men and 1 (5.3%) woman were reclassified into the critical type due to deterioration. Mortality was 3.6% in men and 0 in women respectively. Four (21.1%) women and one man (3.6%) recovered and discharged from hospital. Conclusion: Sex differences may exist in COVID-19 patients of severe type. Men are likely to have more complicated clinical condition and worse in-hospital outcomes as compared to women.

Decisions about its pandemic threat and the appropriate level of public health response depend heavily on estimates of its basic reproduction number and assessments of interventions conducted in the early stages of the epidemic. Methods We conducted a mathematical modeling study using five independent methods to assess the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19, using data on confirmed cases obtained from the China National Health Commission for the period 10th January to 8th February. We analyzed the data for the period before the closure of Wuhan city (10th January to 23rd January) and the post-closure period (23rd January to 8th February) and for the whole period, to assess both the epidemic risk of the virus and the effectiveness of the closure of Wuhan city on spread of COVID-19. Findings Before the closure of Wuhan city the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was 4.38 (95% CI: 3.63-5.13), dropping to 3.41 (95% CI: 3.16-3.65) after the closure of Wuhan city. Over the entire epidemic period COVID-19 had a basic reproduction number of 3.39 (95% CI: 3.09-3.70), indicating it has a very high transmissibility. Interpretation COVID-19 is a highly transmissible virus with a very high risk of epidemic outbreak once it emerges in metropolitan areas. The closure of Wuhan city was effective in reducing the severity of the epidemic, but even after closure of the city and the subsequent expansion of that closure to other parts of Hubei the virus remained extremely infectious. Emergency planners in other cities should consider this high infectiousness when considering responses to this virus.

The transmission potential of 2019-nCoV has been modelled and studied in several recent research works. The key factors such as the basic reproductive number, $R_{0}$, of the virus have been identified by fitting contagious disease spreading models to aggregated data. The data include the reported cases both within China and in closely connected cities over the world. In this paper, we study the transmission potential of 2019-nCoV from the perspective of the robustness of the statistical estimation, in light of varying data quality and timeliness in the initial stage of the outbreak. Sample consensus algorithm has been adopted to improve model fitting when outliers are present. The robust estimation enables us to identify two clusters of transmission models, both are of substantial concern, one with $R_0:8\sim14$, comparable to that of measles and the other dictates a large initial infected group.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Lin</author><author>Sun, Ting</author><author>He, YuFei</author><author>Li, Wendong</author><author>Fan, Yubo</author><author>Zhang, Jing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epitope-based peptide vaccines predicted against novel coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.25.965434</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.25.965434</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected thousands of people with a large number of deaths across 26 countries. The sudden appearance of the virus leads to the limited existing therapies for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, vaccines and antiviral medicines are in desperate need. This study took immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. No mutations were observed in all the selected B- and T-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide. Epitopes were thus identified and some of them can be potential candidates for vaccine development.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, LiXiang</author><author>Yang, ZiHang</author><author>Dang, ZhongKai</author><author>Meng, Cui</author><author>Huang, JingZe</author><author>Meng, HaoTian</author><author>Wang, DeYu</author><author>Chen, GuanHua</author><author>Zhang, JiaXuan</author><author>Peng, HaiPeng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Propagation analysis and prediction of the COVID-19</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.14.20036202</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.14.20036202</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Based on the official data modeling, this paper studies the transmission process of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Despite respiratory symptoms, hepatic injury has also been observed in clinical settings. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors involved with hepatic injury in the patients with COVID-19. Methods: A total of 85 hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Beijing Youan Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to liver function, they were divided into ALT normal group (n=52) and ALT elevation group (n=33). Clinical features and laboratory data were compared between the two groups. The independent risk factors for liver injury were analyzed. Results: There were 33 patients with hepatic injury in our study, accounting for 38.8% (33/85). The patients in ALT elevation group were older than those in ALT normal group. The levels of lactic acid, CRP, myoglobin, and neutrophils were significantly higher in ALT elevation group. The lymphocytes and albumin were significantly lower in ALT elevation group. The proportion of severe and critical patients in ALT elevation group was significantly higher. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed CRP ≥20 mg/L and lymphocyte count&lt; 1.1*10^9/L were independently related to hepatic injury. Conclusions: Lymphopenia and CRP may serve as the risk factors related to hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19, which might be related to inflammatory cytokine storm in liver injury. Early detection and timely treatment of hepatic injury in patients with COVID-19 are necessary. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This study was funded by National Science and Technology Key Project on “Major Infectious Diseases such as HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis Preventon and Treatment” (NO. 2017ZX10203201-005), Beijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals Clinical Medicine Development of Special Funding Support (NO.

The generation of COVID-19-specific antibodies is essential for such tasks. Here we report that polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing animals with synthetic peptides corresponding to different areas of Nucleoprotein (N) of COVID-19. The specificities of the COVID-19 antibodies were assessed by Western Blot analysis against NPs from COVID-19, MERS and SARS. Antibodies were used for immunohistochemistry staining of the tissue sections from COVID-19 infected patient, as a potential diagnostic tool. A Sandwich ELISA kit was quickly assembled for quantitation of the virus/NP of COVID-19 concentrations in the vaccine preparations. Development of POCT is also aggressively undergoing.

We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 1.54 with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, mostly driven by super spreaders.

Thousands of human infections have been diagnosed in China along with many other countries, which exhibited apparent p erson-to-person transmission characteristics of this virus. The capacity of vertical transmission in SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial recently. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is now confirmed as the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and plays essential roles in human infection and transmission. In present study, we collected the online available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to evaluate the cell specific expression of ACE2 in maternal-fetal interface as well as in multiple fetal organs. Our results revealed that ACE2 was highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in placenta. Meanwhile, ACE2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart, liver and lung, but not in kidney. And in a study containing series fetal and post-natal mouse lung, we observed ACE2 was dynamically changed over the time, and ACE2 was extremely high in neonatal mice at post-natal day 1~3. In summary, this study revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 was widely spread in specific cell types of maternal-fetal interface and fetal organs, suggesting the potential capacity for the infection of S ARS-CoV-2 to the fetus through the vertical transmission .</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Na</author><author>Han, Lefei</author><author>Peng, Min</author><author>Lv, Yuxia</author><author>Ouyang, Yin</author><author>Liu, Kui</author><author>Yue, Linli</author><author>Li, Qiannan</author><author>Sun, Guoqiang</author><author>Chen, Lin</author><author>Yang, Lin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia: a case-control study</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.10.20033605</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.10.20033605</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background The ongoing epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have caused serious concerns about its potential adverse effects on pregnancy. There are limited data on maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods We conducted a case-control study to compare clinical characteristics, maternal and neonatal outcomes of pregnant women with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. Results During January 24 to February 29, 2020, there were sixteen pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and eighteen suspected cases who were admitted to labor in the third trimester. Two had vaginal delivery and the rest took cesarean section. Few patients presented respiratory symptoms (fever and cough) on admission, but most had typical chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia. Compared to the controls, COVID-19 pneumonia patients had lower counts of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission. Increased levels of WBC, neutrophils, eosinophils, and CRP were found in postpartum blood tests of pneumonia patients. There were three (18.8%) and two (10.5%) of the mothers with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia had preterm delivery due to maternal complications, which were significantly higher than the control group. None experienced respiratory failure during hospital stay. COVID-19 infection was not found in the newborns and none developed severe neonatal complications. Conclusion Severe maternal and neonatal complications were not observed in pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia who had vaginal delivery or caesarean section. Mild respiratory symptoms of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia highlight the need of effective screening on admission.

To facilitate triage or identification of the large number of COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms in designated fever clinics, we set to identify a practical marker that could be conveniently utilized by first-line health-care workers in clinics. To do so, we performed a case-control study by analyzing clinical and laboratory findings between PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n=52) and SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (n=53). The patients in two cohorts all had similar symptoms, mainly fever and respiratory symptoms. The rates of patients with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) or lymphopenia (two parameters suggested by current National and WHO COVID-19 guidelines) had no differences between these two cohorts, while the rate of eosinopenia (decreased number of eosinophils) in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (79%) was much higher than that in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (36%). When the symptoms were combined with eosinopenia, this combination led to a diagnosis sensitivity and specificity of 79% and 64%, respectively, much higher than 48% and 53% when symptoms were combined with leukocyte counts (normal or decreased number) and/ or lymphopenia. Thus, our analysis reveals that eosinopenia may be a potentially more reliable laboratory predictor for SARS-CoV-2 infection than leukocyte counts and lymphopenia recommended by the current guidelines.

We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. METHODS We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number. RESULTS Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9). CONCLUSIONS On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.

Design and Methods: We forecasted the epidemic of COVID-19 based on current clinical and epidemiological data and built a modified SEIR model to consider both the infectivity during incubation period and the influence on the epidemic from strict quarantined measures. Results: The peak time of the curve for the infected newly diagnosed as COVID-19 should substantially present on Feb.5,2020(in non-Hubei areas) and Feb.19,2020(in Hubei. It is estimated that the peak of the curve of the cumulative confirmed cases will appear in non-Hubei areas on Mar.3,2020 and in Hubei province on Mar.10,2020,and the total number of the patients diagnosed as COVID-19 is 18,000 in non-Hubei areas and 78,000-96,000 in Hubei.The Chinese COVID-19 epidemic can be completely controlled in May,2020. Conclusions: COVID-19 is only a local outbreak in Hubei Province,China.It can be probably avoided the pandemic of global SARS-CoV-2 cases rise with the great efforts by Chinese government and its people.

Many mild infections are typically not reported and, depending on their contagiousness, may support stealth transmission and the spread of documented infection. Methods Here we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the emerging coronavirus, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness. Results We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%-90%]) prior to the Wuhan travel shutdown (January 23, 2020). Per person, these undocumented infections were 52% as contagious as documented infections ([44%-69%]) and were the source of infection for two-thirds of documented cases. Our estimate of the reproductive number (2.23; [1.77-3.00]) aligns with earlier findings; however, after travel restrictions and control measures were imposed this number falls considerably. Conclusions A majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of control measures on January 23, and these undocumented infections substantially contributed to virus transmission. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have been associated with reductions of the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread.

Capacity needs in Chinese cities could inform the planning of local healthcare resources. Methods: We described the intensive care unit (ICU) and inpatient bed needs for confirmed COVID-19 patients in two Chinese cities (Wuhan and Guangzhou) from January 10 to February 29, 2020, and compared the timing of disease control measures in relation to the timing of SARS-CoV-2 community spread. We estimated the peak ICU bed needs in US cities if a Wuhan-like outbreak occurs. Results: In Wuhan, strict disease control measures were implemented six weeks after sustained local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Between January 10 and February 29, COVID-19 patients accounted for an average of 637 ICU patients and 3,454 serious inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 19,425 patients (24.5 per 10,000 adults) were hospitalized, 9,689 (12.2 per 10,000 adults) were considered to be in serious condition, and 2,087 patients (2.6 per 10,000 adults) needed critical care per day. In Guangzhou, strict disease control measures were implemented within one week of case importation. Between January 24 and February 29, COVID-19 accounted for an average of 9 ICU patients and 20 inpatients on each day. During the epidemic peak, 15 patients were in critical condition, and 38 were classified as serious. If a Wuhan-like outbreak were to happen in a US city, the need for healthcare resources may be higher in cities with a higher prevalence of vulnerable populations. Conclusion: Even after the lockdown of Wuhan on January 23, the number of seriously ill COVID-19 patients continued to rise, exceeding local hospitalization and ICU capacities for at least a month. Plans are urgently needed to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 outbreaks on the local healthcare system in US cities. ### Competing Interest Statement ML reports grants from NIH/NIGMS, during the conduct of the study; personal fees from Merck, grants from CDC, grants from Open Philanthropy Project, outside the submitted work.

The recently characterized E protein ion channel activity (EIC) has also been implicated in modulating viral pathogenesis. In this study, we used infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) as a model to study EIC. Two recombinant IBVs (rIBVs) harboring EIC-inactivating mutations - rT16A and rA26F - were serially passaged, and several compensatory mutations were identified in the transmembrane domain (TMD). Two rIBVs harboring these putative EIC-reverting mutations - rT16A/A26V and rA26F/F14N - were recovered. Compared with the parental rIBV-p65 control, all four EIC mutants exhibited comparable levels of intracellular RNA synthesis, structural protein production, and virion assembly. Our results showed that the IBV EIC contributed to the induction of ER stress response, as up-regulation of ER stress-related genes was markedly reduced in cells infected with the EIC-defective mutants. EIC-defective mutants also formed smaller plaques, released significantly less infectious virions into the culture supernatant, and had lower levels of viral fitness in cell culture. Significantly, all these defective phenotypes were restored in cells infected with the putative EIC revertants. EIC mutations were also implicated in regulating IBV-induced apoptosis, induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and viral pathogenicity in vivo. Taken together, this study highlights the importance of CoV EIC in modulating virion release and various aspects of CoV - host interaction.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Tianyi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Simulating the Spread of Epidemics in China on the Multi-layer Transportation Network: Beyond the Coronavirus in Wuhan</title><secondary-title>arXiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>arXiv</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12280</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Based on the SEIR model and the modeling of urban transportation networks, a general-purpose simulator for the spread of epidemics in Chinese cities is built. The Chinese public transportation system between over 340 prefectural-level cities is modeled as a multi-layer bi-partite network, with layers representing different means of transportation (airlines, railways, sail routes and buses), and nodes divided into two categories (central cities, peripheral cities). At each city, an open-system SEIR model tracks the local spread of the disease, with population in- and out-flow exchanging with the overlying transportation network. The model accounts for (1) different transmissivities of the epidemic on different transportation media, (2) the transit of inbound flow at cities, (3) cross-infection on public transportation vehicles due to path overlap, and the realistic considerations that (4) the infected population are not entering public transportation and (5) the recovered population are not subject to repeated infections. The model could be used to simulate the city-level spread in China (and potentially other countries) of an arbitrary epidemic, characterized by its basic reproduction number, incubation period, infection period and zoonotic force, originated from any Chinese prefectural-level city(s), during the period before effective government interventions are implemented. Flowmaps are input into the system to trigger inter-city dynamics, assuming different flow strength, determined from empirical observation, within/between the bi-partite divisions of nodes. The model is used to simulate the 2019 Coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan; it shows that the framework is robust and reliable, and simulated results match public city-level datasets to an extraordinary extent.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Xingguang</author><author>Zai, Junjie</author><author>Zhao, Qiang</author><author>Nie, Qing</author><author>Li, Yi</author><author>Foley, Brian T</author><author>Chaillon, Antoine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evolutionary history, potential intermediate animal host, and cross-species analyses of SARS-CoV-2.</title><secondary-title>Journal of medical virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of medical virology</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>J Med Virol</publisher><accession-num>32104911</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jmv.25731</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32104911</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>To investigate the evolutionary history of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in China, a total of 70 genomes of virus strains from China and elsewhere with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 3 February 2020 were analyzed. To explore the potential intermediate animal host of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we re-analyzed virome datasets from pangolins and representative SARS-related coronaviruses isolates from bats, with particular attention paid to the spike glycoprotein gene. We performed phylogenetic, split network, transmission network, likelihood-mapping, and comparative analyses of the genomes. Based on Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip-dating method, we estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2, which ranged from 22-24 November 2019 and 1.19-1.31 × 10-3 substitutions per site per year, respectively. Our results also revealed that the BetaCoV/bat/Yunnan/RaTG13/2013 virus was more similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus than the coronavirus obtained from the two pangolin samples (SRR10168377 and SRR10168378). We also identified a unique peptide (PRRA) insertion in the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which may be involved in the proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein by cellular proteases, and thus could impact host range and transmissibility. Interestingly, the coronavirus carried by pangolins did not have the RRAR motif. Therefore, we concluded that the human SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the recent outbreak of COVID-19, did not come directly from pangolins. This article is protected by copyright.

Strict control measures are being enforced in either the populated areas and remote regions. While the virus is closed to be under control, tremendous economic loss has been caused. Methods and findings We assessed the pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV for all cities/regions in China using the random forest algorithm, taking into account the effect of five factors: the accumulative and increased numbers of confirmed cases, total population, population density, and GDP. We defined four levels of the risk, corresponding to the four response levels to public health emergencies in China. The classification system has good consistency among cities in China, as the error rate of the confusion matrix is 1.58%. Conclusions The pandemic risk of 2019-nCoV is dramatically different among the 442 cities/regions. We recommend to adopt proportionate control policy according to the risk level to reduce unnecessary economic loss.

However, under the strict control policy the novel coronavirus does not spread naturally outside Hubei Province, and none of the prediction closes to the real situation. Methods and findings: We used the traditional SEIR model, fully estimated the effect of control measures, to predict the virus transmission in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, and Beijing. We forecast that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV would reach its peak around March 6±10 in Wuhan and March 20±16 in Beijing, respectively. The infectious population in Beijing would be much less (only 0.3%) than those in Wuhan at the peak of this transmission wave. The number of confirmed cases in cities inside Hubei Province grow exponentially, whereas those in cities outside the province increase linearly. Conclusions: The unprecedented province lockdown substantially suspends the national and global outbreak of 2019-nCoV. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement None. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

As of February 13, 2020, a total of 59883 cases of COVID-19 in China have been confirmed and 1368 patients have died from the disease. However, the clinical characteristics of the dyed patients were still not clearly clarified. This study aims to summarize the clinical characteristics of death cases with COVID-19 and to identify critically ill patients of COVID-19 early and reduce their mortality. Methods The clinical records, laboratory findings and radiologic assessments included chest X-ray or computed tomography were extracted from electronic medical records of 25 died patients with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 14 to Feb 13, 2020. Two experienced clinicians reviewed and abstracted the data. Findings The mean age of the dead was 71.48 years, the average course of the disease was 10.56 days, all patients eventually died of respiratory failure. All of those who died had underlying diseases, the most common of which was hypertension (16/25, 64%), followed by diabetes (10/25, 40%), heart diseases (8/25, 32%), kidney diseases (5/25, 20%), cerebral infarction (4/25, 16%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 2/25, 8%), malignant tumors (2/25, 8%) and acute pancreatitis (1/25, 4%). The most common organ damage outside the lungs was the heart, followed by kidney and liver. In the patients' last examination before death, white blood cell and neutrophil counts were elevated in 17 patients (17/25, 68%) and 18 patients (18/25, 72%), lymphocyte counts were decreased in 22 patients (22/25, 88%). Most patients' PCT, CRP and SAA levels were elevated, the percentages were 90.5% (19/21), 85% (19/20) and 100% (21/21) respectively. The levels of the last test of neutrophils (15/16, 93.8%), PCT (11/11, 100%), CRP (11/13, 84.6%), cTnI (8/9, 88.9%), D-Dimer (11/12, 91.6%) and LDH (9/9, 100%) were increased as compared to the first test, while the levels of lymphocytes were decreased (14/16, 87.5%). Interpretation The age and underlying diseases (hypertension, diabetes, etc.) were the most important risk factors for death of COVID-19 pneumonia. Bacterial infections may play an important role in promoting the death of patients. Malnutrition was common to severe patients. Multiple organ dysfunction can be observed, the most common organ damage was lung, followed by heart, kidney and liver. The rising of neutrophils, SAA, PCT, CRP, cTnI, D-Dimer and LDH levels can be used as indicators of disease progression, as well as the decline of lymphocytes counts.

Investigations on the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with this virus are ongoing. Currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic antibody to prevent the infection, and more time is required to develop an effective immune strategy against the pathogen. In contrast, specific inhibitors targeting the key protease involved in replication and proliferation of the virus are the most effective means to alleviate the epidemic. The main protease of SARS-CoV is essential for the life cycle of the virus, which showed 96.1% of similarity with the main proteaseof 2019-nCoV, is considered to be an attractive target for drug development. In this study, we have identified 4 small molecular drugs with high binding capacity with SARS-CoV main protease by high-throughput screening based on the 8,000 clinical drug libraries, all these drugs have been widely used in clinical applications with guaranteed safety, which may serve as promising candidates to treat the infection of 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Yang</author><author>Zhao, Ruihong</author><author>Zheng, Shufa</author><author>Chen, Xu</author><author>Wang, Jinxi</author><author>Sheng, Xiaoli</author><author>Zhou, Jianying</author><author>Cai, Hongliu</author><author>Fang, Qiang</author><author>Yu, Fei</author><author>Fan, Jian</author><author>Xu, Kaijin</author><author>Chen, Yu</author><author>Sheng, Jifang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lack of Vertical Transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, China</title><secondary-title>Emerging Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Emerging Infectious Diseases</full-title></periodical><volume>26</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Emerg Infect Dis</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.3201/eid2606.200287</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0287_article.htm</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Yi</author><author>Liang, Meng</author><author>Yin, Xianhong</author><author>Liu, Xiaoyu</author><author>Hao, Meng</author><author>Hu, Zixin</author><author>Wang, Yi</author><author>Jin, Li</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>COVID-19 Epidemic Outside China: 34 Founders and Exponential Growth</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.01.20029819</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.01.20029819</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Li et al. - 2020 - COVID-19 Epidemic Outside China 34 Founders and Exponential Growth.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: In December 2019, pneumonia infected with a novel coronavirus burst in Wuhan, China. Now the situation is almost controlled in China but is worse outside China. We aimed to build a mathematical model to capture the global trend of epidemics outside China. Methods: In this retrospective, outside-China diagnosis number reported from Jan 21 to Feb 28, 2020 was downloaded from WHO website. We develop a simple regression model on these numbers: log10 (Nt+34)=0.0515*t+2.075 where Nt is the total diagnosed patient till the ith day, t=1 at Feb 1. Findings: Based on this model, we estimate that there have been about 34 unobserved founder patients at the beginning of spread outside China. The global trend is approximately exponential, with the rate of 10 folds every 19 days.

We aimed to use a mathematical model to predict number of diagnosed patients in future to ease anxiety on the emergent situation. In this retrospective, all diagnosis number from Jan 21 to Feb 10, 2020 reported from China was included and downloaded from WHO website. We develop a simple but accurate formula to predict the next day diagnosis number:N\_i/N\_(i-1) =〖(N\_(i-1)/N\_(i-2) )〗^α，where Ni is the total diagnosed patient till the ith day, and α was estimated as 0.904 at Feb 10. Based on this model, it is predicted that the rate of disease infection will decrease exponentially. The total number of infected people is limited; thus, the disease will have limited impact.

Although the virus (SARS-Cov-2) nucleic acid RT-PCR test has become the standard method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, these real-time PCR test kits have many limitations. In addition, high false negative rates were reported. There is an urgent need for an accurate and rapid test method to quickly identify large number of infected patients and asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment of patients. We have developed a rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay which can detect IgM and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages. With this test kit, we carried out clinical studies to validate its clinical efficacy uses. The clinical detection sensitivity and specificity of this test were measured using blood samples collected from 397 PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 128 negative patients at 8 different clinical sites. The overall testing sensitivity was 88.66% and specificity was 90.63%. In addition, we evaluated clinical diagnosis results obtained from different types of venous and fingerstick blood samples. The results indicated great detection consistency among samples from fingerstick blood, serum and plasma of venous blood. The IgM-IgG combined assay has better utility and sensitivity compared with a single IgM or IgG test. It can be used for the rapid screening of SARS-CoV-2 carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in hospitals, clinics, and test laboratories. This article is protected by copyright.

However, the clinical symptoms varied in different reports. Based on the results of inter-group difference test, we found that the incidence of diarrhea differed in three recent reports. As 2019-nCoV utilizes the same cell entry receptor ACE2 as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and ACE2 tightly controls intestinal inflammation, to trace the route of infection mediated by 2019-nCoV, we used the single-cell RNA sequencing data for analysis. We found that the ACE2 mRNA was highly expressed in the healthy human small intestine rather than the lung. Besides, single-cell RNA sequencing data showed that ACE2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the foreign pathogen. Thus, we suspect that ACE2-expressing small intestinal epithelium cells might be vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection when people eat infected wild animals and diarrhea may serve as an indicator for infection, suggesting that clinicians should pay more attention to patients with diarrhea during the outbreak of pneumonia.

Then we tracked the data from 24 o'clock on January 29 to 24 o'clock on January 31, and found that the predicted value of the data on the 3rd has a small deviation from the actual value, and the actual value has always remained within the range predicted by the comprehensive prediction model 6.

We aimed to describe the prevalence and clinical features of COVID-19 as compared to pneumonias of other etiologies in a Fever Clinic in Beijing. Methods In this single-center, retrospective study, 342 cases of pneumonia were diagnosed in Fever Clinic in Peking University Third Hospital between January 21 to February 15, 2020. From these patients, 88 were reviewed by panel discussion as possible or probable cases of COVID-19, and received 2019-nCoV detection by RT-PCR. COVID-19 was confirmed by positive 2019-nCoV in 19 cases, and by epidemiological, clinical and CT features in 2 cases (the COVID-19 Group, n=21), while the remaining 67 cases served as the non-COVID-19 group. Demographic and epidemiological data, symptoms, laboratory and lung CT findings were collected, and compared between the two groups. Findings The prevalence of COVID-19 in all pneumonia patients during the study period was 6.14% (21/342). Compared with the non-COVID-19 group, more patients with COVID-19 had an identified epidemiological history (90.5% versus 32.8%, P&lt;0.001). The COVID-19 group had lower WBC [5.19×10^9/L (±1.47) versus 7.21×10^9/L (±2.94), P&lt;0.001] and neutrophil counts [3.39×10^9/L (±1.48) versus 5.38×10^9/L (±2.85), P&lt;0.001] in peripheral blood. However, the percentage and count of lymphocytes were not different. On lung CT scans, involvement of 4 or more lobes was more common in the COVID-19 group (45% versus 16.4%, P=0.008). Interpretation In the period of COVID-19 epidemic outside Hubei Province, the prevalence of COVID-19 in patients with pneumonia visiting to our Fever Clinic in Beijing was 6.14%. Epidemiological evidence was important for prompt case finding, and lower blood WBC and neutrophil counts may be useful for differentiation from pneumonia of other etiologies.

However, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of them are still unknown. Methods: We collected data of 46 confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 10 to 35 years from the study hospital. The demographics, epidemiological, and clinical data were collected. Several key epidemiological parameters, the asymptomatic cases and transmission to their family members and the clinical characteristics at admission, and during treatment were summarized. RESULTS: Of 46 confirmed patients, 14 patients (47.3%) were aged from 10 to 24 years, and 24 (52.7%) patients were male. The mean incubation period for symptomatic cases was 6.6 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.4 - 9.6). The median serial interval was 1.9 days (95% CI 0.4 - 6.2). Three of asymptomatic cases showed the transmission to their family members. Only 1 patient was identified as severe cases at admission. The common symptoms at admission were dry cough (34, 91.0%), and fever (29, 69.0%). Nearly 60% of the patients had showed ground-glass opacity by chest CT findings. Three patients developed acute kidney injury during treatment. Majority of patients (78.3%) were discharged by the end of the follow-up. Conclusions: The adolescent and young adult patients of COVID-19 had a long incubation period, and a short serial interval. The transmission to their family contactors occurred in asymptomatic cases. Few of the study patients have developed complications during treatment.

The symptoms of COVID-19 varied from modest, mild to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the latter of which is generally associated with deregulated immune cytokine production; however, we currently know little as to the interplay between the extent of clinical symptoms and the compositions of lung immune microenvironment. Here, we comprehensively characterized the lung immune microenvironment with the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 3 severe and 3 mild COVID-19 patients and 8 previously reported healthy lung controls through single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) combined with TCR-seq. Our data shows that monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages, whereas notFABP4+ alveolar macrophages that represent a predominant macrophage subset in BALF from patients with mild diseases, overwhelm in the severely damaged lungs from patients with ARDS. These cells are highly inflammatory and enormous chemokine producers implicated in cytokine storm. Furthermore, the formation of tissue resident, highly expanded clonal CD8+ T cells in the lung microenvironment of mild symptom patients suggests a robust adaptive immune response connected to a better control of COVID-19. This study first reported the cellular atlas of lung bronchoalveolar immune microenvironment in COVID-19 patients at the single-cell resolution, and unveiled the potential immune mechanisms underlying disease progression and protection in COVID-19.

Diagnostic test based on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR) was the main means of confirmation, and sample collection was mostly throat swabs, which was easy to miss the diagnosis. It is necessary to seek specimen types with higher detection efficiency and accuracy. Methods: Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases, and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by qRT-PCR assay. Results: The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using qRT-PCR assay (P=0.001). Conclusions: The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are significantly higher than throat swabs. We suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum. The results can facilitate the selection of specimens and increase the accuracy of diagnosis.

The COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and rapidly spread to other regions and countries. The variation in transmission patterns and disease spread in regard to time or among different locations, partially reflecting the public health in- tervention effects, remains to be quantified. As most transmissibility-related epidemic parameters are unknown, we sought, with minimal assumptions, to estimate real-time transmissibility and forecast new cases using dynamic modelling. Method: Using the cases reported from the National Health Commission of China and transportation data, including the total number of travelling hours through railway, airplane, and car outbound from Wuhan, we have built a time-series model to estimate real-time underlying transmission rates of newly generated cases sequentially from January 20, 2020 to Feb 13, 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei province and other 28 provinces in China. We quantified the instantaneous transmission rate and relative reproduction number (R\_t) of COVID-19, and evaluated whether public health intervention affected the case transmissibility in each province. Based on the current estimates, we have predicted the trend of disease spread with a high level of certainty. Findings: We estimated that R\_t declined from the range of 4 to 5 towards 1 and remained below unity, while there was an initial growth followed by a decline in a shorter period in Hubei and other provinces. The ratio of transmission rates decreased dramatically from January 23 to 27 likely due to the rigorous public health intervention implemented by the government beginning on January 23, 2020. The mean duration of the infectious period was 6 to 9 days. We have predicted the trend of infection sizes which be- came stable in provinces around February 19 to 24, 2020, and the date of containment would be one-week later in Wuhan. Interpretation: Public health interventions implemented at both the so- cial and personal levels are effective in preventing outbreaks of COVID-19 in Wuhan and other provinces. Model prediction results suggested that COVID- 19 will be contained around the end of February 2020 in China.

In all the simulations, the binding between ritonavir and coronavirus endopeptidase C30 was most suitable. In addition, both ritonavir and lopinavir seemed more suitable to bind to coronavirus endopeptidase C30 than papain like viral protease.

Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute kidney injury has been observed in some patients with 2019-nCoV. In a short period of time, angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), have been proposed to serve as the receptor for the entry of 2019-nCoV, which is the same for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS). To investigate the possible cause of kidney damage in 2019-nCoV patients, we used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data and an independent unpublished kidney single cell RNA-Seq data generated in-house to evaluate ACE2 gene expressions in all cell types in healthy kidneys and bladders. Our results showed the enriched expression of all subtypes of proximal tubule cells of kidney and low but detectable levels of expression in bladder epithelial cells. These results indicated the urinary system is a potential route for 2019-nCoV infection, along with the respiratory system and digestion system. Our findings suggested the kidney abnormalities of SARS and 2019-nCoV patients may be due to proximal tubule cells damage and subsequent systematic inflammatory response induced kidney injury. Beyond that, laboratory tests of viruses and related indicators in urine may be needed in some special patients of 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lin, Yuan-Chien</author><author>Chi, Wan-Ju</author><author>Lin, Yu-Ting</author><author>Lai, Chun-Yeh</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The spatiotemporal estimation of the dynamic risk and the international transmission of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: A global perspective</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.29.20029413</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.29.20029413</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>An ongoing novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia infection outbreak called COVID-19 started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. It both spread rapidly to all provinces in China and started spreading around the world quickly through international human movement from January 2020. Currently, the spatiotemporal epidemic transmission patterns, prediction models, and possible risk analysis for the future are insufficient for COVID-19 but we urgently need relevant information, particularly from the global perspective. We have developed a novel two-stage simulation model to simulate the spatiotemporal changes in the number of COVID-19 cases and estimate the future worldwide risk. Based on the connectivity of countries to China and the country's medical and epidemic prevention capabilities, different scenarios are generated to analyze the possible transmission throughout the world and use this information to evaluate each country's vulnerability to and the dynamic risk of COVID-19. Countries' vulnerability to the COVID-19 outbreak from China is calculated for 63 countries around the world. Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan are the most vulnerable areas. The relationship between each country's vulnerability and days before the first imported case occurred shows a very high exponential decrease. The cumulative number of cases in each country also has a linear relationship with vulnerability, which can compare and quantify the initial epidemic prevention capabilities to various countries' management strategies. In total, 1,000 simulation results of future cases around the world are generated for the spatiotemporal risk assessment. According to the simulation results of this study, if there is no specific medicine for it, it will likely form a global pandemic. This method can be used as a preliminary risk assessment of the spatiotemporal spread for a new global epidemic. * Note: This study was completed on February 15, 2020.

Migration events put travelers at risk of infection for the duration of their exposure to an area where transmission is known to occur. Using publicly available data of the ongoing epidemic of 2019-nCoV where event dates for cases have been shared, the present study estimated the incubation period and other time intervals that govern interpretation of the epidemiological dynamics of 2019-nCoV infections. Our results show that the incubation periods falls within the range of two to nine days with 95% confidence, and the median incubation period is 4-5 days when approximated using the Weibull distribution, which was the best fit model. The median time from illness onset to hospitalization was estimated at 3 days. Based on the estimate of the 95th percentile estimate of the incubation period, we recommend that the length of isolation and quarantine should be at least nine days. We also note that the median time delay of 13.8 days from illness onset to death should be considered when estimating the case fatality risk of this novel virus.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementH.N. received funding from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) [grant number: JP18fk0108050]; the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [grant numbers, H.N.: 17H04701, 17H05808, 18H04895 and 19H01074; R.K.: 18J21587], the Inamori Foundation, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) CREST program [grant number: JPMJCR1413].

This pandemic disease has now been defined as novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and is sustained by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As the current gold standard for the etiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is (real time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract specimens, the diagnostic accuracy of this technique shall be considered a foremost prerequisite. Overall, potential RT-PCR vulnerabilities include general preanalytical issues such as identification problems, inadequate procedures for collection, handling, transport and storage of the swabs, collection of inappropriate or inadequate material (for quality or volume), presence of interfering substances, manual errors, as well as specific aspects such as sample contamination and testing patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. Some analytical problems may also contribute to jeopardize the diagnostic accuracy, including testing outside the diagnostic window, active viral recombination, use of inadequately validated assays, insufficient harmonization, instrument malfunctioning, along with other specific technical issues. Some practical indications can hence be identified for minimizing the risk of diagnostic errors, encompassing the improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining clinical evidence with results of chest computed tomography (CT) and RT-PCR, interpretation of RT-PCR results according to epidemiologic, clinical and radiological factors, recollection and testing of upper (or lower) respiratory specimens in patients with negative RT-PCR test results and high suspicion or probability of infection, dissemination of clear instructions for specimen (especially swab) collection, management and storage, together with refinement of molecular target(s) and thorough compliance with analytical procedures, including quality assurance.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Chenyun</author><author>Yang, Yun-zhi</author><author>Zhang, Xiao Ming</author><author>Xu, Xinying</author><author>Dou, Qing-Li</author><author>Zhang, Wen-Wu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The prevalence and influencing factors for anxiety in medical workers fighting COVID-19 in China: A cross-sectional survey</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.05.20032003</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.05.20032003</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Abstract: Background: The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the SARS-Cov-2 virus has been sustained in China since December 2019, and could become a pandemic if we do not contain it. The mental health of frontline medical staff is a concern. In this study, we aimed to identify the influencing factors on medical worker anxiety in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of anxiety among medical staff from 10th February 2020 to 20th February 2020 in China using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, using the criteria of normal (≤49), mild (50-59), moderate (60-70) and severe anxiety (≥70). We used multivariable linear regression to determine the factors (e.g., having direct contact treating infected patients, being a medical staff worker from Hubei province, being a suspect case) for anxiety. We also used adjusted models to confirm independent factors for anxiety after adjusting for gender, age, education and marital status. Results: Of 512 medical staff from China, 164 healthcare workers (32.03%) had had direct contact by treating infected patients. The prevalence of anxiety was 12.5%, with 53 workers suffering from mild (10.35%), seven workers from moderate (1.36%) and four workers from severe anxiety (0.78%). After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education and marital status), medical staff who had had direct contact treating infected patients saw higher anxiety scores than those who had not had direct contact (βvalue=2.33, CI: 0.65 -4.00; p=0.0068). Similar things were observed in medical staff from Hubei province, compared with those from other parts of China (βvalue=3.67, CI: 1.44 -5.89; p=0.0013). The most important variable was suspect cases with high anxiety scores, compared to non-suspect cases (βvalue=4.44, CI: 1.55 -7.33; p=0.0028). Conclusion: Our results highlight that government authorities should make early detection of the high risk of anxiety among medical staff a priority, and implement appropriate psychological intervention programs, to prevent medical staff from developing psychological disorders that could potentially exert an adverse effect on combating the COVID-19 epidemic.

To fight against COVID-19, we carried out research for the near native SARS-CoV-2 and report here our preliminary results obtained. The pathogen of the COVID-19, the native SARS-CoV-2, was isolated, amplified and purified in a BSL-3 laboratory. The whole viral architecture of SARS-CoV-2 was examined by transmission electron microscopy (both negative staining and cryo-EM). We observed that the virion particles are roughly spherical or moderately pleiomorphic. Spikes have nail-like shape towards outside with a long body embedded in the envelope. The morphology of virion observed in our result indicates that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is in post-fusion state, with S1 disassociated. This state revealed by cryo-EM first time could provide an important information for the identification and relevant clinical research of this new coronavirus.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Furong</author><author>Long, Xin</author><author>Zou, Wenbin</author><author>Fang, Minghao</author><author>Wu, Wenjuan</author><author>Li, Wei</author><author>Zhang, Bixiang</author><author>Zhang, Wanguang</author><author>Chen, Xiaoping</author><author>Zhang, Zhanguo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Highly ACE2 Expression in Pancreas May Cause Pancreas Damage After SARS-CoV-2 Infection</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.28.20029181</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.28.20029181</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in the end of 2019 in China has triggered a global public health crisis. Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects cells by binding angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the same as SARS-CoV. The expression and distribution of ACE2 in the pancreas are unknown. At the same time, the injury of pancreas after SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been concerned. Here, we collected public datasets (bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq) to indicate the expression and the distribution of ACE2 in pancreas (in both exocrine glands and islets). And further, clinical data including mild and severe patients with COVID-19 demonstrated there existed mild pancreatitis. In the 67 severe cases, 11 patients (16.41%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, and 5 patients (7.46%) showed imaging alterations. Only one patient (1.85%) showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase in 54 mild cases, without imaging changes. Our study revealed the phenomenon and possible cause of mild pancreatic injury in patients with COVID-19. This suggests that pancreatitis after SARS-CoV-2 infection should also be paid attention in clinical work.

As of 20 Feb 2020, a total of 2,055 medical staff confirmed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-Cov-2 in China had been reported. We sought to explore the epidemiological, clinical characteristics and prognosis of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff. Methods In this retrospective study, 64 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus-infected medical staff admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan between 16 Jan, 2020 to 15 Feb, 2020 were included. Two groups concerned were extracted from the subjects based on duration of symptoms: group 1 (&lt;= 10 days) and group 2 (&gt;10 days). Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed and compared across groups. The Kaplan-Meier plot was used to inspect the change in hospital discharge rate. The Cox regression model was utilized to identify factors associated with hospital discharge. Findings The median age of medical staff included was 35 years old. 64% were female and 67% were nurses. None had an exposure to Huanan seafood wholesale market or wildlife. A small proportion of the cohort had contact with specimens (5%) as well as patients in fever clinics (8%) and isolation wards (5%). Fever (67%) was the most common symptom, followed by cough (47%) and fatigue (34%). The median time interval between symptoms onset and admission was 8.5 days. On admission, 80% of medical staff showed abnormal IL-6 levels and 34% had lymphocytopenia. Chest CT mainly manifested as bilateral (61%), subpleural (80%) and ground-glass (52%) opacities. During the study period, no patients was transferred to intensive care unit or died, and 34 (53%) had been discharged. Higher body mass index (BMI) (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03-0.73), fever (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.60) and higher levels of IL-6 on admission (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.11-0.87) were unfavorable factors for discharge. Interpretation In this study, medical staff infected with COVID-19 have relatively milder symptoms and favorable clinical course, which may be partly due to their medical expertise, younger age and less underlying diseases. Smaller BMI, absence of fever symptoms and normal IL-6 levels on admission are favorable for discharge for medical staff. Further studies should be devoted to identifying the exact patterns of SARS-CoV-2 infection among medical staff. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Clinical Trial This is not a clinical trial. ### Funding Statement This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers: 81873919).

Method: Peripheral blood samples were longitudinally collected from 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients and examined for lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. Findings: Of the 40 COVID-19 patients enrolled, 13 severe cases showed significant and sustained decreases in lymphocyte counts but increases in neutrophil counts than 27 mild cases. Further analysis demonstrated significant decreases in the counts of T cells, especially CD8 + T cells, as well as increases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and IFN-γ levels in the peripheral blood in the severe cases compared to those in the mild cases. T cell counts and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of the mild cases. Moreover, the neutrophil-to-CD8+ T cell ratio (N8R) were identified as the most powerful prognostic factor affecting the prognosis for severe COVID-19. Conclusion: The degree of lymphopenia and a proinflammatory cytokine storm is higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases, and is associated with the disease severity. N8R may serve as a useful prognostic factor for early identification of severe COVID-19 cases.

We aimed to select the most useful prognostic factor for severe illness incidence. Methods: The study prospectively included 61 patients with 2019-nCoV infection treated at Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 13, 2020 to January 31, 2020. Prognostic factor of severe illness was selected by the LASSO COX regression analyses, to predict the severe illness probability of 2019-CoV pneumonia. The predictive accuracy was evaluated by concordance index, calibration curve, decision curve and clinical impact curve. Results: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was identified as the independent risk factor for severe illness in patients with 2019-nCoV infection. The NLR had a c-index of 0.807 (95% confidence interval, 0.676-0.38), the calibration curves fitted well, and the decision curve and clinical impact curve showed that the NLR had superior standardized net benefit. In addition, the incidence of severe illness was 9.1% in age ≥ 50 and NLR &lt; 3.13 patients, and half of patients with age ≥ 50 and NLR ≥ 3.13 would develop severe illness. Based on the risk stratification of NLR with age, the study developed a 2019-nCoV pneumonia management process. Conclusions: The NLR was the early identification of risk factors for 2019-nCoV severe illness. Patients with age ≥ 50 and NLR ≥ 3.13 facilitated severe illness, and they should rapidly access to intensive care unit if necessary.

OBJECTIVE To analyze the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with new-type coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). METHODS This is a retrospective study of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) who were hospitalized in Hainan Provincial People's Hospital from January 15, 2020 to February 18, 2020. Compare the clinical characteristics of elderly with Young and Middle-aged patients. RESULTS A total of 56 patients were evaluated, 18 elderly patients (32.14%), and 38 young and middle-aged patients (67.86%). The most common symptoms in both groups were fever, followed by cough and sputum. Four patients in the elderly group received negative pressure ICU for mechanical ventilation, and five patients in the young and middle-aged group. One patient died in the elderly group (5.56%), and two patients died in the young and middle-aged group (5.26%). The PSI score of the elderly group was higher than that of the young and middle-aged group (P&lt;0.001). The proportion of patients with PSI grades IV and V was significantly higher in the elderly group than in the young and middle-aged group (P&lt;0.05). The proportion of multiple lobe involvement in the elderly group was higher than that in the young and middle-aged group (P&lt;0.001), and there was no difference in single lobe lesions between the two groups. The proportion of lymphocytes in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the young and middle-aged group (P&lt;0.001), and the C-reactive protein was significantly higher in the young group (P&lt;0.001). The Lopinavir and Ritonavir Tablets, Chinese medicine, oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation were statistically different in the elderly group and the young and middle-aged group, and the P values were all &lt;0.05.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, L</author><author>Gao, Jian-ya</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical characteristics of 51 patients discharged from hospital with COVID-19 in Chongqing，China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.20.20025536</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.20.20025536</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Abstract Background：Since December 2019, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2（SARS-CoV-2）-infected disease (Coronavirus Disease 2019，COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan , China，and rapidly spread throughout China，even throughout the world. We try to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in non-Wuhan area，and explore its effective treatment. Methods：Retrospective, single-center case series of the 51 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 at Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital in Chongqing, China, from January 20 to February 3, 2020；The discharge time was from January 29 to February 11, 2020. The main results and indicators of epidemiology, demography, clinical manifestation, laboratory examination, imaging data and treatment data of 51 patients with covid-19 were collected and analyzed. The changes of blood routine and biochemical indexes at discharge and admission were compared. Compare the clinical characteristics of severe patients (including severe and critical patients) and non- severe patients (general patients). Results： Of 51 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 45 years (interquartile range, 34-51; range, 16-68 years) and 32 (62.7%) were men.43（84.3%）patients had been to Wuhan or Other Hubei areas outside Wuhan，and 4（7.7%） patients had a clear contact history of COVID-19 patients before the onset of the disease, and 4（7.7%） patients had no clear epidemiological history of COVID-19.Common symptoms included fever (43 [84.3%]), cough (38 [74.5%]) and fatigue (22 [43.1%]). Lymphopenia was observed in 26 patients (51.0%), and elevated C-reactive protein level in 32 patients (62.7%). Ground-glass opacity was the typical radiological finding on chest computed tomography (41 [80.4%])，Local consolidation of pneumonia in some patients(17 [33.3%]).Most of the patients were treated with traditional Chinese medicine decoction (28 [54.9%])，all of them received aerosol inhalation of recombinant human interferon a-1b for injection and oral antiviral therapy with Lopinavir and Ritonavir tablets (51 [100%]); Most of the patients were given Bacillus licheniformis capsules regulated intestinal flora treatment (44 [86.3%]). 10 patients (19.6%) received short-term (3-5 days) glucocorticoid treatment. Compared with non-severe patients (n = 44), severe patients (n = 7) were older (median age, 52 years vs 44 years), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (4 [57.1%] vs 0 [0.0%]), most of them needed antibiotic treatment (7 [100%] vs 4 [9.1%], most of them needed nutritional diet (6 [85.7%) vs 0 [0.0%], and were more likely to have dyspnea (6 [85.7%] vs 5 [11.4%])，most of them needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation (6 [85.7%] vs 0 [0.0%]). Except one patient died, the remaining 50 patients were discharged according to the discharge standard, the common clinical symptoms disappeared basically, the lymphocyte increased significantly (P=0.008), CRP decreased significantly (P &lt;0.001). The median length of stay was 12 days (IQR, 9-13). Conclusion：In 51 single center cases confirmed as COVID-19 and discharged from the hospital, 13.7% of the patients were severe. The main clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19 were fever, cough and asthenia，Some patients had obvious dyspnea. They had clinical laboratory and radiologic characteristics. There is no specific drug treatment for the disease. For the treatment of COVID-19, in addition to oxygen inhalation and antiviral treatment, attention should be paid to the dialectical treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, regulation of intestinal flora, nutritional support treatment and other comprehensive treatment. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Clinical Trial This is a retrospective study.This case series was approved by the institutional ethics board of Chongqing University Three Gorges Hospital. ### Funding Statement Funding: Project No.2020CDJGRH-YJ03 supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central 230 Universities.Role of the Funder/Sponsor: The funders had no role in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; and decision to submit the manuscript for publication. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of serological assay for SARS-CoV-2. Methods A newly-developed ELISA assay for IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein of SARS-CoV-2 were used to screen the serums of 238 admitted hospital patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 6 to February 14, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by real time RT-PCR on pharyngeal swab specimens. Findings Of the 238 patients, 194 (81.5%) were detected to be antibody (IgM and/or IgG) positive, which was significantly higher than the positive rate of viral RNA (64.3%). There was no difference in the positive rate of antibody between the confirmed patients (83.0%, 127/153) and the suspected patients (78.8%, 67/85) whose nucleic acid tests were negative. After the patients were defined to the different stages of disease based on the day when the test samples were collected, the analysis results showed that the antibody positive rates were very low in the first five days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly increased as the disease progressed. After 10 days, the antibody positive rates jumped to above 80% from less than 50%. On the contrary, the positive rates of viral RNA kept above 60% in the first 11 days after initial onset of symptoms, and then rapidly decreased. In addition, half of the suspected patients with symptoms for 6-10 days were detected to be antibody positive. Interpretation The suspected patients were most likely infected by SARS-CoV-2. Before the 11th day after initial onset of symptoms, nucleic acid test is important for confirmation of viral infection. The combination of serological assay can greatly improve the diagnostic efficacy. After that, the diagnosis for viral infection should be majorly dependent on serological assay. Keywords.

Our model is initialized using the daily counts of active and confirmed COVID-19 cases across the US. Based on our model predictions for the March 14-16 timeframe, the national epidemic peak could be expected to arrive by early June, corresponding to a daily active count of ≈ 7% of the US population, if no containment plans are implemented. Epidemic peaks are expected to arrive in the states of Washington and New York by May 21 and 25, respectively. With a modest 25% reduction in COVID-19 transmissibility via community-level interventions, the epidemic progression could be delayed by up to 34 days. Wholesale interstate traffic restriction is ineffective in delaying the epidemic outbreak, but it does desynchronize the arrival of state-wise epidemic peaks, which could potentially alleviate the burden on limited available medical resources. In addition to forecasting the arrival timeline of the state-wise epidemic peaks, we attempt at informing the optimal timing necessary to enforce community-level interventions. Our findings underscore the pressing need for preparedness and timely interventions in states with a large fraction of the vulnerable uninsured and liquid-asset-poverty populations.

In this study, we assembled the genomes of coronaviruses identified in sick pangolins. The molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that pangolin Coronaviruses (pangolin-CoV) are genetically related to both the 2019-nCoV and bat Coronaviruses but do not support the 2019-nCoV arose directly from the pangolin-CoV. Our study also suggested that pangolin be natural host of Betacoronavirus, with a potential to infect humans. Large surveillance of coronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses in pangolins. Conservation of wildlife and limits of the exposures of humans to wildlife will be important to minimize the spillover risks of coronaviruses from wild animals to humans.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Qinghe</author><author>Liu, Zhicheng</author><author>Li, Deqiang</author><author>Gao, Zefei</author><author>Zhu, Junkai</author><author>Yang, Junyan</author><author>Wang, Qiao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing the Tendency of 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) Outbreak in China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.09.20021444</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.09.20021444</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Since December 1, 2019, the spread of COVID-19 is increasing every day. It is particularly important to predict the trend of the epidemic for the timely adjustment of the economy and industries. We proposed a Flow-SEHIR model in this paper to perform the trends of 2019-nCoV (COVID-19) in China. The results show that the number of daily confirmed new cases reaches the inflection point on Feb. 6-10 outside Hubei. For the maximum of temporal infected cases number, the predicted peak value in China except Hubei was estimated to be 21721 (95% CI: 18764-24929). The peak arrival time is on March 3-9. The temporal number of patients in most areas of China outside Hubei will peak from March 12 to March 15. The peak values of more than 73.5% provinces or regions in China will be controlled within 1000. According to Flow-SEHIR model and estimations from the data of evacuation of nationals from Wuhan, the real peak cumulative number of patients in Hubei is estimated to be 403481 (95% CI: 143284-1166936). ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement no funding support ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Clinical data is limited up to now regarding the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19. Aims: This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of the association of cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods: Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan in Wuhan, China, from January 15 to January 24, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs. Results: Of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5%, while 87.8% of all had history of patient contact. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 +- 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever (82.9%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5%) and cough (63.4%). While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5%), fever (73.2%) and cough (41.5%). There were 95.1% cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China. Patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5% and 41.5%, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 +- 0.43 and 1.55 +- 0.61, P&lt;0.001), more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission (50.0% and 11.8%, P=0.011), and more received oxygen support (79.2% and 23.5%, P&lt;0.001). The rate of in-hospital adverse events was significantly higher in patients with CVMs group (75.0% and 23.5%, P=0.001). Multivariable logistic regression model indicated that, coexisting with CVMs in COVID-19 patients was not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events. Conclusions: Most of hospital staff with COVID-19 had history of patient contact, featured non-severe course of disease. Cases with CVMs suffered from more in-hospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But concomitant CVMs were not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in COVID-19 patients. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement Science and Technology Department of Hubei Province (No. 2019CFC843); Beijing United Heart Foundation (No. BJUHFCSOARF201901-19) ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Methods: Data on NCP cases by February 7, 2020 were collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing and HongKong during 2002-2003 were also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R0) and time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of NCP and SARS. Measurements and main results: As of February 7, 2020, 34,598 NCP cases were identified in China, and daily confirmed cases decreased after February 4. The doubling time of NCP nationwide was 2.4 days which was shorter than that of SARS in Guangdong (14.3 days), Hong Kong (5.7 days) and Beijing (12.4 days). The R0 of NCP cases nationwide and in Wuhan were 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, which were higher than R0 of SARS in Guangdong(R0=2.3), Hongkong (R0=2.3), and Beijing (R0=2.6). The Rt for NCP continuously decreased especially after January 16 nationwide and in Wuhan. The R0 for secondary NCP cases in Guangdong was 0.6, and the Rt values were less than 1 during the epidemic. Conclusions: NCP may have a higher transmissibility than SARS, and the efforts of containing the outbreak are effective. However, the efforts are needed to persist in for reducing time-varying reproduction number below one.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Tao</author><author>Zhang, Jieying</author><author>Yang, Yuhui</author><author>Ma, Hong</author><author>Li, Zhengyu</author><author>Zhang, Jiaoyue</author><author>Cheng, Ji</author><author>Zhang, Xiaoyun</author><author>Zhao, Yanxia</author><author>Xia, Zihan</author><author>Zhang, Liling</author><author>Wu, Gang</author><author>Yi, Jianhua</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The potential role of IL-6 in monitoring severe case of coronavirus disease 2019</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.01.20029769</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.01.20029769</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Liu et al. - 2020 - The potential role of IL-6 in monitoring coronavirus disease 2019.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Abstract. Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China spreads rapidly since December, 2019. Most patients show mild symptoms, but some of them develop into severe disease. There is currently no specific medication. The purpose of this study is to to explore changes of markers in peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 patients, which may be of value in disease monitoring. Methods Clinical data of patients with nonsevere and severe type COVID-19 diagnosed by laboratory test in our institution were collected. The relationship between peripheral blood cells and cytokines, clinical manifestation and outcome was analyzed. Results A total of 69 severe type COVID-19 patients were included. On admission, the median age of severe cases was 56-year old, with 52.17% female patient. The most common symptoms were fever (79.72%), cough (63.77%), shortness of breath (57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%). Diarrhea is less common. The most common comorbidity is hypertension. Upon admission, the proportion of bilateral pulmonary involvement and interstitial abnormalities evidenced by chest computed tomography (CT) imaging in severe cases was 60.87% and 27.54%, respectively. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease showed obvious lymphocytopenia. Elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer was found in most cases. Two patients (2.9%) needed transfer to the intensive care unit. Baseline immunological parameters and most of the inflammatory parameters were basically within the normal range. However, baseline interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly increased in severe type, which was closely related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and to CT findings. Baseline IL-6 was also significantly related to the increase of baseline level of CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer. The increase of baseline IL-6 level suggests that it may positively correlate with the severity of COVID-19. Among the 30 severe type patients whose IL-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. Whereas the IL-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to disease progression. It is suggested that IL-6 may be used as a marker for disease monitoring in severe COVID-19 patients. Conclusions On admission, the baseline level of IL-6, CRP, LDH and ferritin was closely related to the severity of COVID-19, and the elevated IL-6 was significantly related to the clinical manifestation of severe type patients. The decrease of IL-6 was closely related to treatment effectiveness, while the increase of IL-6 indicated disease exacerbation. Collectively, the dynamic change of IL-6 level can be used as a marker for disease monitoring in patients with severe COVID-19. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Clinical Trial This is a retrospective observational study for 2019 novel coronavirus disease.

However, the genetic underpinnings, as well as the scale and magnitude at which this differentiation occurs in marine habitats are not well understood. We investigated the patterns and degree of genomic heterogeneity in threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) by assessing genetic variability in 20 nongenic and 20 genic (associated with genes important for freshwater adaptation) microsatellite loci in samples collected from 38 locations spanning the entire Baltic Sea coast to the North Sea boundary. Population divergence (F(ST) ≈ 0.026) and structuring (five genetic clusters) was significantly more pronounced in the genic as compared to nongenic markers (F(ST) ≈ 0.008; no genetic clusters). Patterns of divergence in the genic markers--45% of which were identified as outliers--correlated with local differences in salinity. Yet, a strong positive correlation between divergence in genic and nongenic markers, and their association with environmental factors suggests that adaptive divergence is reducing gene flow across the genome. Apart from providing a clear demonstration of heterogeneous genomic patterns of differentiation in a marine species, the results are indicative of adaptive population structuring across the relatively young Baltic Sea in spite of ample opportunities for gene flow.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Xiaoyan</author><author>Li, Zhe</author><author>Liu, Shuai</author><author>Chen, Zhanghua</author><author>Zhao, Zhiyao</author><author>Huang, Yi-you</author><author>Zhang, Qingling</author><author>Wang, Jun</author><author>Shi, Yinyi</author><author>Xu, Yanhui</author><author>Sun, Jing</author><author>Xian, Huifang</author><author>Fang, Rongli</author><author>Bai, Fan</author><author>Ou, Changxing</author><author>Xiong, Bei</author><author>Lew, Andrew M</author><author>Cui, Jun</author><author>Huang, Hui</author><author>Zhao, Jincun</author><author>Hong, Xuechuan</author><author>Zhang, Yuxia</author><author>Zhou, Fulin</author><author>Luo, Hai-Bin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Therapeutic effects of dipyridamole on COVID-19 patients with coagulation dysfunction</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.27.20027557</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.27.20027557</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>The human coronavirus HCoV-19 infection can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypercoagulability, hypertension, extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction. Effective antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, HCoV-19 infected patients could potentially benefit from DIP adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery. Larger scale clinical trials of DIP are needed to validate these therapeutic effects.

We estimated model parameters from published information with the statistical method and stochastic simulation, we found the parameters that achieved the best simulation test result. The next stage involved quantitative predictions of future epidemic developments based on different containment strategies with the QSEIR model, focused on the sensitivity of the outcomes to different parameter choices in mainland China. The main results are as follows. If the strict quarantine measures are being retained, the peak value of confirmed cases would be in the range of [52438, 64090] and the peak date would be expected in the range February 7 to February 19, 2020. During March18-30, 2020, the epidemic would be controlled. The end date would be in the period from August 20 to September 1, 2020. With 80% probability, our prediction on the peak date was 4 days ahead of the real date, the prediction error of the peak value is 0.43%, both estimates are much closer to the observed values compared with published studies. The sensitive analysis indicated that the quarantine measures (or with vaccination) are the most effective containment strategy to control the epidemic, followed by measures to increase the cured rate (like finding special medicine). The long-term simulation result and sensitive analysis in mainland China showed that the QSEIR model is stable and can be empirically validated. It is suggested that the QSEIR model can be applied to predict the development trend of the epidemic in other regions or countries in the world. In mainland China, the quarantine measures can't be relaxed before the end of March 2020. China can fully resume production with appropriate anti-epidemic measures beginning in early April 2020. The results of this study also implied that other countries now facing the epidemic outbreaks should act more decisively and take in time quarantine measures though it may have negative short-term public and economic consequences.

We report the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infected patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and further investigate the treatment and the progression of the disease. Methods: The longitudinal study included 109 patients with novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan between January 2 and February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics, treatment, and outcomes data were collected from electronic medical records. The difference in treatment and progression between patients with ARDS and without ARDS was compared. Results: Among 109 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55 years (IQR, 43-66 years; range, 22-94 years), and 59 (54.1%) patients were men. The median hospital days were 15 days (interquartile range, 11-24 days), and 31 (28.4%) patients had died and 78 (71.6%) survived. Among them, 53 (48.6%) patients developed ARDS. Compared with non-ARDS patients, patients with ARDS were more likely to have coexisting conditions, including diabetes (20.8% vs. 1.8%), cerebrovascular (11.3% vs. 0%) and chronic kidney disease (15.1% vs. 3.6%). Compared with patients with mild ARDS (n = 1/19 [5.3%]), those with moderate and severe ARDS had a higher mortality rate (n = 15/24 [62.5%] for moderate ARDS and n = 10/10 [100.0%] for severe ARDS). The mortality rate increased concomitantly with the severity of ARDS. We have not observed a significant effect of antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival in patients with ARDS. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that 2019-nCoV infected patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS had higher mortality rates and the beneficial effects of current treatments were not satisfactory, which are warranted attention from clinicians. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Clinical Trial Not available ### Funding Statement Dr. Yu is supported by the Health and Family Planning Commission of Wuhan Municipality, grant number WX18A02. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Infection with M. tuberculosis (MTB), the pathogen that causes TB and latently infects ~25% of the global population, may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Objective: To determine if latent or active TB increase susceptibility to SARS-COV-19 infection and disease severity, and lead to more rapid development of COVID-19 pneumonia. Design: An observational case-control study of 36 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Shenyang, China, conducted in Feb 2020. Final date of follow-up: Feb 29, 2020. Cases were grouped according to COVID-19 pneumonia severity (mild/moderate, severe/critical), and MTB infection status compared. Comparisons were made with MTB infection data from another case-control study on bacterial/viral pneumonia at Shenyang Chest Hospital. Setting: Multi-center study involving three primary care hospitals in Shenyang, China. Participants: 86 suspected COVID-19 cases from participating primary-care hospitals in Shenyang. All 36 SARS-CoV-2 +ve cases (based on RT-PCR assay) were included. Disease severity was assessed using the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines of the National Health Commission of China (v6). Mean age, 47 years (range: 25-79), gender ratio, 1:1. Exposures: Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Interferon-gamma Release Assays (IGRA) were performed using peripheral blood to determine MTB infection. Main Outcome and Measures: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were collected. Comparison of MTB infection status between patients with mild/moderate and severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Results: Mean age of 36 COVID-19 patients: 47 (range: 25-79); M/F: 18/18; Wuhan/Hubei connection: 42%. Mild/moderate cases: 27 (75%); severe/critical: 9 (25%). MTB infection (IGRA+ve): 13 cases (36.11%), including 7 of 9 severe/critical cases. MTB infection rate: higher in COVID-19 (36.11%) than bacterial pneumonia (20%; p=0.0047) and viral pneumonia patients (16.13%; p=0.024). MTB infection more common than other co-morbidities (36.11% vs diabetes: 25%; hypertension: 22.2%; coronary heart disease: 8.33%; COPD: 5.56%). MTB co-infection linked with disease severity (severe/critical 78% vs mild/moderate cases 22%; p=0.0049), and rate of disease progression: infection to development of symptoms (MTB+SARS-CoV-2: 6.5+/-4.2 days vs SARS-COV-2: 8.9+/-5.2 days; p=0.073); from symptom development to diagnosed as severe (MTB+SARS-CoV-2: 3.4+/-2.0 days vs SARS-COV-2: 7.5+/-0.5 days; p=0.075). Conclusions and Relevance: MTB infection likely increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, and increases COVID-19 severity, but this requires validation in a larger study. MTB infection status of COVID-19 patients should be checked routinely at hospital admission.

Methods and results Data were collected from patients medical records, and we defined cardiac injury according to cardiac biomarker troponin I level &gt; 0.03&gt;ug/L. Among the 291 patients, 15 (5.2%) showed evidence of cardiac injury. Of 16 hospitalized patients with cardiac injury, the median age was 62 years, and 11/15 (73.3%) were men. Underlying cardiovascular diseases in some patients were hypertension (n=7, 46.6%), coronary heart disease (n=3, 20%) and diabetes (n=3, 20%). The most common symptoms at illness onset in patients with cardiac injury were fever (n=11, 73.3%), cough (n=7, 46.7%), headache or fatigue (n=5, 33.3%) and dyspnoea (n=4, 26.6%). These patients had higher systolic pressures, and lower lymphocyte counts and platelet counts, compared with patients without cardiac injury, respectively. Bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray and elevated C-reactive protein occurred in all patients with cardiac injury. Compared with patients without cardiac injury, patients with cardiac injury were more likely to develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (73.3%), and receive mechanical ventilation (53.4%), continuous renal replacement therapy (33.3%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (26.7%) and vasopressor therapy (26.7%) and be admitted to the intensive care unit (73.3%). One patient died during the study. Conclusion Cardiac injury is a common condition among patients infected with 2019-nCoV.Compared with patients without cardiac injury, the clinical outcomes of patients with cardiac injury are relatively worse.

While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through human respiratory droplets and contact with infected persons is clear, the aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been little studied. Methods: Thirty-five aerosol samples of three different types (total suspended particle, size segregated and deposition aerosol) were collected in Patient Areas (PAA) and Medical Staff Areas (MSA) of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Renmin) and Wuchang Fangcang Field Hospital (Fangcang), and Public Areas (PUA) in Wuhan, China during COVID-19 outbreak. A robust droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method was employed to quantitate the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and determine aerosol RNA concentration. Results: The ICU, CCU and general patient rooms inside Renmin, patient hall inside Fangcang had undetectable or low airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but deposition samples inside ICU and air sample in Fangcang patient toilet tested positive. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 in Fangcang MSA had bimodal distribution with higher concentration than those in Renmin during the outbreak but turned negative after patients number reduced and rigorous sanitization implemented. PUA had undetectable airborne SARS-CoV-2 concentration but obviously increased with accumulating crowd flow. Conclusions: Room ventilation, open space, proper use and disinfection of toilet can effectively limit aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gathering of crowds with asymptomatic carriers is a potential source of airborne SARS-CoV-2. The virus aerosol deposition on protective apparel or floor surface and their subsequent resuspension is a potential transmission pathway and effective sanitization is critical in minimizing aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Zhihua</author><author>Magal, Pierre</author><author>Seydi, Ousmane</author><author>Webb, Glenn</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting the cumulative number of cases for the COVID-19 epidemic in China from early data</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.11.20034314</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.11.20034314</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>We model the COVID-19 coronavirus epidemic in China.

Ebola virus disease (EVD), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are zoonotic viruses that have caused significant recent outbreaks with sustained human-to-human transmission. This investigation quantified changing mean removal rates (MRR) and days from symptom onset to hospitalization (DSOH) of infected individuals from the population in seven different outbreaks of EVD, SARS, and MERS, to test for statistically significant differences in these metrics between outbreaks.

While genetically distinct from the original SARS-CoV, both group 2B coronaviruses share similar genome organization and origins to coronaviruses harbored in bats. Importantly, initial guidance has used insights from SARS-CoV infection to inform treatment and public health strategies. In this report, we evaluate SARS-CoV-2 relative to the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication kinetics to SARS-CoV in Vero cell, the novel coronavirus is much more sensitive to type I interferon pretreatment. We subsequently examined homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonist. The absence of open reading frame (ORF) 3b and significant changes to ORF6 suggest the two key IFN antagonists may not maintain equivalent function in SARS-CoV-2. Together, the results identify key differences in susceptibility to the IFN response between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that could help inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lombardi, Andrea</author><author>Bozzi, Giorgio</author><author>Mangioni, Davide</author><author>Muscatello, Antonio</author><author>Maria, Anna</author><author>Taramasso, Lucia</author><author>Ungaro, Riccardo</author><author>Bandera, Alessandra</author><author>Gori, Andrea</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Duration of quarantine in hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection: a question needing an answer</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hospital Infection</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hospital Infection</full-title></periodical><volume>2</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>The Healthcare Infection Society</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.003</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Long, Justin B</author><author>Ehrenfeld, Jesse M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Role of Augmented Intelligence (AI) in Detecting and Preventing the Spread of Novel Coronavirus.</title><secondary-title>Journal of medical systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of medical systems</full-title></periodical><pages>59</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>3</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0148-5598</isbn><accession-num>32020374</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10916-020-1536-6</electronic-resource-num><notes>1573-689x

Molecular techniques, such as quantitative real-time RT-PCR and nucleic acid sequencing methods, are widely used to identify pathogens. For this particular virus, however, they have an overall unsatisfying detection rate, due to its relatively recent emergence and still not completely understood features. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is remarkably similar to other Coronaviruses, and it can present with other respiratory infections, making identification even harder. To tackle this issue, we propose an assisted detection test, combining molecular testing with deep learning. The proposed approach employs a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network, able to automatically create features starting from the genome sequence of the virus. Experiments on data from the Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) show that the proposed approach is able to correctly classify SARS-CoV-2, distinguishing it from other coronavirus strains, such as MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and SARS-CoV regardless of missing information and errors in sequencing (noise). From a dataset of 553 complete genome non-repeated sequences that vary from 1,260 to 31,029 bps in length, the proposed approach classifies the different coronaviruses with an average accuracy of 98.75% in a 10-fold cross-validation, identifying SARS-CoV-2 with an AUC of 98%, specificity of 0.9939 and sensitivity of 1.00 in a binary classification. Then, using the same basis, we classify SARS-CoV-2 from 384 complete viral genome sequences with human host, that contain the gene ORF1ab from the NCBI with a 10-fold accuracy of 98.17% , a specificity of 0.9797 and sensitivity of 1.00. These preliminary results seem encouraging enough to identify deep learning as a promising research venue to develop assisted detection tests for SARS-CoV-2. At this end the interaction between viromics and deep learning , will hopefully help to solve global infection problems. In addition, we offer our code and processed data to be used for diagnostic purposes by medical doctors, virologists and scientists involved in solving the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As more data become available we will update our system.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lu, Hongzhou</author><author>Ai, Jingwen</author><author>Shen, Yinzhong</author><author>Li, Yang</author><author>Li, Tao</author><author>Zhou, Xian</author><author>Zhang, Haocheng</author><author>Zhang, Qiran</author><author>Ling, Yun</author><author>Wang, Sheng</author><author>Qu, Hongping</author><author>Gao, Yuan</author><author>Li, Yingchuan</author><author>Yu, Kanglong</author><author>Zhu, Duming</author><author>Zhu, Hecheng</author><author>Tian, Rui</author><author>Zeng, Mei</author><author>Li, Qiang</author><author>Song, Yuanlin</author><author>Li, Xiangyang</author><author>Xu, Jinfu</author><author>Xu, Jie</author><author>Mao, Enqiang</author><author>Hu, Bijie</author><author>Li, Xin</author><author>Zhu, Lei</author><author>Zhang, Wenhong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A descriptive study of the impact of diseases control and prevention on the epidemics dynamics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Shanghai, lessons learned for metropolis epidemics prevention</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.19.20025031</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.19.20025031</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Objective: To describe and evaluate the impact of diseases control and prevention on epidemics dynamics and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Shanghai. Design: A retrospective descriptive study Setting: China Participants: Epidemiology information was collected from publicly accessible database. 265 patients admitted to Shanghai Public Health Center with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled for clinical features analysis. Main outcome measure: Prevention and control measures taken by Shanghai government, epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collected. Weibull distribution, Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, t test or Mann-Whitney U test were used in statistical analysis. Results: COVID-19 transmission rate within Shanghai had reduced over 99% than previous speculated, and the exponential growth has been stopped so far. Epidemic was characterized by the first stage mainly composed of imported cases and the second stage where &gt;50% of cases were local. The incubation period was 6.4 (95% CI 5.3 to 7.6) days and the mean onset-admission interval was 5.5 days (95% CI, 5.1 to 5.9). Median time for COVID-19 progressed to severe diseases were 8.5 days (IQR: 4.8-11.0 days). By February 11th, proportion of patients being mild, moderate, severe and critically ill were 1.9%(5/265), 89.8%(238/265), 3.8%(10/265), 4.5%(12/265), respectively; 47 people in our cohort were discharged, and 1 patient died. Conclusion: Strict controlling of the transmission rate at the early stage of an epidemic in metropolis can quickly prohibit the spread of the diseases. Controlling local clusters is the key to prevent outbreaks from imported cases. Most COVID-19 severe cases progressed within 14 days of disease onset. Multiple systemic laboratory abnormalities had been observed before significant respiratory dysfunction. Keyword: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, epidemics dynamics, diseases control, clinical features

Approaches to efficient management are urgently needed and key to a quicker control of the outbreaks and casualties. We aimed to characterize the clinical features of hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and develop a mortality risk index for COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this retrospective one-centre cohort study, we included all the confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a COVID-19-designated hospital from January 21 to February 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and clinical outcome data were collected from the hospital information system, nursing records and laboratory reports. Results: Of 577 patients with at least one post-admission evaluation, the median age was 55 years (interquartile range [IQR], 39 - 66); 254 (44.0%) were men; 22.8% (100/438) were severe pneumonia on admission, and 37.7% (75/199) patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The clinical, laboratory and radiological data were comparable between positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. During a median follow-up of 8.4 days (IQR, 5.8 - 12.0), 39 patients died with a 12-day cumulative mortality of 8.7% (95% CI, 5.9% to 11.5%). A simple mortality risk index (called ACP index), composed of Age and C-reactive Protein, was developed. By applying the ACP index, patients were categorized into three grades. The 12-day cumulative mortality in grade three (age ≥ 60 years and CRP ≥ 34 mg/L) was 33.2% (95% CI, 19.8% to 44.3%), which was significantly higher than those of grade two (age ≥ 60 years and CRP &lt; 34 mg/L; age &lt; 60 years and CRP ≥ 34 mg/L; 5.6% [95% CI, 0 to 11.3%]) and grade one (age &lt; 60 years and CRP &lt; 34 mg/L, 0%) (P &lt;0.001), respectively. Conclusion: The ACP index can predict COVID-19 related short-term mortality, which may be a useful and convenient tool for quickly establishing a COVID-19 hierarchical management system that can greatly reduce the medical burden and therefore mortality in highly endemic areas.

A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. METHODS: We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus. FINDINGS: The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues. INTERPRETATION: 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.

We aim to devise novel ways to model, visualise and analyse the temporal dynamics of epidemic outbreaks in order to help researchers and other people involved in crisis response to make well-informed and targeted decisions about from which geographical locations and time periods more genetic samples may be required to fully understand the outbreak. Our approach relies on the application of Transcendental Information Cascades to a set of temporally ordered nucleotide sequences and we apply it to real-world data that was collected during the currently ongoing outbreak of the novel 2019-nCoV coronavirus. We assess information-theoretic and network-theoretic measures that characterise the resulting complex network and suggest touching points and temporal pathways that are of interest for deeper investigation by geneticists and epidemiologists. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No external funding was received for this research. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

SARS-CoV-2 was reported to enter cells via binding to ACE2, followed by its priming by TMPRSS2. Here, we investigate ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression levels and their distribution across cell types in lung tissue (twelve donors, 39,778 cells) and in cells derived from subsegmental bronchial branches (four donors, 17,521 cells) by single nuclei and single cell RNA sequencing, respectively. While TMPRSS2 is expressed in both tissues, in the subsegmental bronchial branches ACE2 is predominantly expressed in a transient secretory cell type. Interestingly, these transiently differentiating cells show an enrichment for pathways related to RHO GTPase function and viral processes suggesting increased vulnerability for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

For coronaviruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an important protease that catalyze the replication of RNA from RNA template and is an attractive therapeutic target. In this study, we screened these chemical structures from traditional Chinese medicinal compounds proven to show anti-viral activity in SARS-CoV and the similar chemical structures through a molecular docking study to target RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We found that theaflavin has a lower idock score in the catalytic pocket of RdRp in SARS-CoV-2 (-9.11 kcal/mol), SARS-CoV (-8.03 kcal/mol) and MERS-CoV (-8.26 kcal/mol) from idock. To confirm the result, we discovered that theaflavin has a lower binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol when it docks in the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by using the Blind Docking server. Regarding contact modes, hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were found between theaflavin and RdRp. Moreover, one π-cation interaction was formed between theaflavin and Arg553 from the Blind Docking server. Our results suggest that theaflavin could be potential SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor for further study. This article is protected by copyright.

Previous studies have supported an epidemiological hypothesis that cold and dry (low absolute humidity) environments facilitate the survival and spread of droplet-mediated viral diseases, and warm and humid (high absolute humidity) environments see attenuated viral transmission (i.e., influenza). However, the role of absolute humidity in transmission of COVID-19 has not yet been established. Here, we examine province-level variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across China and find that changes in weather alone (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the North Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in COVID-19 case counts without the implementation of extensive public health interventions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialNAFunding StatementMS and CP are partially supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R01GM130668.

To reveal the evolution mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 genome, we performed comprehensive genomic analysis with newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 strains and 20 closely related coronavirus strains. Among 98 nucleotide mutations at 93 sites of the genome among different SARS-CoV-2 strains, 58 of them caused amino acid change, indicating a result of neutral evolution. However, the ratio of nucleotide substitutions to amino acid substitutions of spike gene (9.07) between SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 and Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13 was extensively higher than those from comparisons between other coronaviruses (range 1.29 - 4.81). The elevated synonymous mutations between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, suggesting they underwent stronger purifying selection. Moreover, their nucleotide substitutions are enriched with T:C transition, which is consistent with the mutation signature caused by deactivity of RNA 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN). The codon usage was similar between SARS-CoV-2 and other strains in beta-coronavirus lineage B, suggesting it had small impact on the mutation pattern. In comparison of SARS-CoV-2 WIV04 with Bat-SARSr-CoV RaTG13, the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) was the lowest among all performed comparisons, reconfirming the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 under stringent selective pressure. Moreover, some sites of spike protein might be subjected to positive selection. Therefore, our results will help understanding the evolutionary mechanisms contribute to viral pathogenicity and its adaptation with hosts.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ma, Shujuan</author><author>Zhang, Jiayue</author><author>Zeng, Minyan</author><author>Yun, Qingping</author><author>Guo, Wei</author><author>Zheng, Yixiang</author><author>Zhao, Shi</author><author>Wang, Maggie H</author><author>Yang, Zuyao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological parameters of coronavirus disease 2019: a pooled analysis of publicly reported individual data of 1155 cases from seven countries</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.21.20040329</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.21.20040329</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, while several key epidemiological parameters of the disease remain to be clarified. This study aimed to obtain robust estimates of the incubation period, upper limit of latent period (interval between exposure of infector and infectee), serial interval, time point of exposure and basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19. Methods Between late February and early March of 2020, the individual data of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 were retrieved from 10728 publicly available reports released by the health authorities of and outside China and from 1790 publications identified in PubMed and CNKI. To be eligible, a report had to contain the data that allowed for estimation of at least one parameter. As relevant data mainly came from clustering cases, the clusters for which no evidence was available to establish transmission order were all excluded to ensure accuracy of estimates. Additionally, only the cases with an exposure period spanning 3 days or less were included in the estimation of parameters involving exposure date, and a simple method for determining exposure date was adopted to ensure the error of estimates be small (&lt; 0.3 day). Depending on specific parameters, three or four of normal, lognormal, Weibull, and gamma distributions were fitted to the datasets and the results from appropriate models were presented. Findings In total, 1155 cases from China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Germany and Malaysia were included for the final analysis. The mean and standard deviation were 7.44 days and 4.39 days for incubation period, 2.52 days and 3.95 days for the upper limit of latent period, 6.70 days and 5.20 days for serial interval, and -0.19 day (i.e., 0.19 day before symptom onset of infector) and 3.32 days for time point of exposure. R0 was estimated to be 1.70 and 1.78 based on two different formulas. For 39 (6.64%) cases, the incubation periods were longer than 14 days. In 102 (43.78%) infector-infectee pairs, transmission occurred before the symptom onsets of infectors. In 27 (3.92%) infector-infectee pairs, symptom onsets of infectees occurred before those of infectors. Stratified analysis showed that incubation period and serial interval were consistently longer for those with less severe disease and for those whose primary cases had less severe disease. Asymptomatic transmission was also observed. Interpretation This study obtained robust estimates of several key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19. The findings support current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure, but also suggest that longer monitoring periods might be needed for selected groups. The estimates of serial interval, time point of exposure and latent period provide consistent evidence on pre-symptomatic transmission. This together with asymptomatic transmission and the generally longer incubation and serial interval of less severe cases suggests a high risk of long-term epidemic in the absence of appropriate control measures.

However, Impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD center and HD patients are still unknown. In this report, we reviewed the whole course of the epidemic emerged in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University from January 14, 2020, the day the first case was confirmed, to February 17, 2020, the day the epidemic extinction. There are totally 37 cases among 230 HD patients and 4 cases among 33 staff being diagnosed with COVID-19. The epidemiology, clinical presentation and immune profile of dialysis patients contracted COVID-19 were further studied. We found that the two key measures we took in response to the epidemic, one was upgrading level of prevention and protection on January 21 and the other one starting universal screening, isolating, and distributing the infected cases on February 4, were effective in the epidemic control. No new COVID-19 case had been diagnosed since February 13. During the epidemic, 7 HD patients died, including 6 with COVID-19 and 1 without COVID-19. The presumed causes of death were not directly related to pneumonia, but due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, hyperkalemia, etc. Most of the leukocytes in the peripheral blood of the HD patients infected with COVID-19 decreased, and the CT images of the chest mostly showed the ground glass like changes on the right side. The symptoms of most of the patients were mild, and there were no cases admitted to ICU. The frequency of lymphocytes in PBMCs and the serum level of inflammatory cytokines were assessed in HD patients contracted COVID-19 or not, non-HD COVID-19 patients, as well as healthy volunteers. The results showed that lymphocytes of T cell, Th cells, killer T cells, as well as NK cells in PBMCs of HD patients decreased significantly than other groups. HD patients with COVID-19 also displayed remarkable lower serum level of inflammatory cytokines than other COVID-19 patients. Our study indicates that HD patients are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high risk area in the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. Measures of prevention, protection, screening, isolation, and distribution are essential in the epidemic management and should be taken in the early stage. HD Patients with COVID-19 are mostly clinical mild and unlikely progress to severe pneumonia due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokines storm. More attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts of COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work was supported by the grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (#81370800 to Dr. Huiming Wang, # 81800615 to Dr. Yiqiong Ma), the Key Project on Science and Technology Innovation of Hubei Province (#2019ACA137 to Dr. Huiming Wang), the Key Project on Health Commision of Hubei Province ( #WJ 2019Z011 to Ming Shi) ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

This study aims to explore the association between coronavirus disease (COVID-19) death and weather parameters. Methods In this study, we collected the daily death number of COVID-19, meteorological and air pollutant data from 20 January, 2020 to 29 February, 2020 in Wuhan, China. Then, the generalized additive model was applied to explore the impact of temperature, humidity and diurnal temperature range on daily mortality of COVID-19. Results There were in total 2299 COVID-19 mortality counts in Wuhan. A positive association with COVID-19 mortality was observed for diurnal temperature range (r = 0.44), but negative association for relative humidity (r = −0.32). In addition, each 1 unit increase in diurnal temperature range was only associated with a 2.92% (95% CI: 0.61%, 5.28%) increase in COVID-19 mortality at lag 3. However, both per 1 unit increase of temperature and absolute humidity were related to the decreased COVID-19 mortality at lag 3 and lag 5, respectively. Conclusion In summary, this study suggests the temperature variation and humidity may be important factors affecting the COVID-19 mortality.

Methodologically, we introduced TPL (Taylor power law) to characterize their spatiotemporal heterogeneity/stability and Hubbell (2001) unified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB) [specifically Harris et al. (2015) HDP-MSN model (hierarchical Dirichlet process multi-site neutral model)] to approximate the metapopulation of coronavirus infections. First, TPL analysis suggested that the coronaviruses appear to have a specific heterogeneity/stability scaling parameter (TPL-b) slightly exceeding 2 for cumulative infections or exceeding 1 for daily incremental infections, suggesting their potentially chaotic, unstable outbreaks. Another TPL parameter (M0) (i.e., infection critical threshold) depends on virus kinds (COVID-19/SARS), time (disease-stages), space (regions) and public-health interventions (e.g., quarantines and mobility control). M0 measures the infection level, at which infections are random (Poisson distribution) and below which infections follow uniform distribution and may die off if M0 coincides or below the level of Allee effects. It was found that COVID-19 outbreak seems nearly twice more risky than SARS, and the lower infection threshold may be due to its lower lethality than SARS since lower fatality rates can facilitate the survival and spread of pathogen. Second, metacommunity UNTB neutrality testing seems appropriate for approximating metapopulation of coronavirus infections. Specifically, two parameters {\theta} and M, borrowed from neutral theory, may be used to assess the relative significance of infection through local contagion vs. infection through migration, both of which may depend on time, space, virus kinds, and particularly public-health interventions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Macchiagodena, Marina</author><author>Pagliai, Marco</author><author>Procacci, Piero</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inhibition of the Main Protease 3CL-pro of the Coronavirus Disease 19 via Structure-Based Ligand Design and Molecular Modeling</title><secondary-title>arXiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>arXiv</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09937</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>We have applied a computational strategy, based on the synergy of virtual screening, docking and molecular dynamics techniques, aimed at identifying possible lead compounds for the non-covalent inhibition of the main protease 3CL-pro$ of the SARS-Cov2 Coronavirus.

The universality of this behavior indicates that, in spite of social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population. These insights may aid the implementation of containment strategies in potential export induced COVID-19 secondary outbreaks elsewhere or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases.

The scientific interest on coronaviruses increased after the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreaks in 2002-2003 followed by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). deaths reported in China only and one death outside China (Philippines). In a short span of time, the virus spread has been noted in 24 countries. The zoonotic transmission (animal-to-human) is suspected as the route of disease origin. The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable source of 2019-nCoV though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of the novel virus. The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well. The successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostics and effective vaccines helping in combating the spread of the virus to newer areas.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manning, Jessica E</author><author>Bohl, Jennifer A</author><author>Lay, Sreyngim</author><author>Chea, Sophana</author><author>Ly, Sovann</author><author>Sengdoeurn, Yi</author><author>Heng, Seng</author><author>Vuthy, Chan</author><author>Kalantar, Katarina</author><author>Ahyong, Vida</author><author>Tan, Michelle</author><author>Sheu, Jonathan</author><author>Tato, Christina M</author><author>DeRisi, Joseph</author><author>Baril, Laurence</author><author>Dussart, Philippe</author><author>Duong, Veasna</author><author>Karlsson, Erik A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rapid metagenomic characterization of a case of imported COVID-19 in Cambodia</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.02.968818</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.02.968818</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Rapid production and publication of pathogen genome sequences during emerging disease outbreaks provide crucial public health information.

DESIGN: Retrospective case series SETTING: Three designated COVID-19 care hospitals of the Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fourteen hospitalized patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Data were collected from 16 January 2020 to 19 February 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records and reviewed by a trained team of physicians. Neurological symptoms fall into three categories: central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or diseases (headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy), peripheral nervous system (PNS) symptoms (hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypopsia, and neuralgia), and skeletal muscular symptoms. Data of all neurological symptoms were checked by two trained neurologists. RESULTS: Of 214 patients studied, 88 (41.1%) were severe and 126 (58.9%) were non-severe patients. Compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were older (58.7 ± 15.0 years vs 48.9 ± 14.7 years), had more underlying disorders (42 [47.7%] vs 41 [32.5%]), especially hypertension (32 [36.4%] vs 19 [15.1%]), and showed less typical symptoms such as fever (40 [45.5%] vs 92 [73%]) and cough (30 [34.1%] vs 77 [61.1%]). Seventy-eight (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations. More severe patients were likely to have neurologic symptoms (40 [45.5%] vs 38 [30.2%]), such as acute cerebrovascular diseases (5 [5.7%] vs 1 [0.8%]), impaired consciousness (13 [14.8%] vs 3 [2.4%]) and skeletal muscle injury (17 [19.3%] vs 6 [4.8%]). CONCLUSION: Compared with non-severe patients with COVID-19, severe patients commonly had neurologic symptoms manifested as acute cerebrovascular diseases, consciousness impairment and skeletal muscle symptoms.

The previous epidemics of high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, prompted the characterization of compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The most promising compound is remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide analog prodrug currently in clinical trials for treating Ebola virus infections. Remdesivir inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in tissue cultures, and it displayed efficacy in non-human animal models. In addition, a combination of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitors, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-INFb) were shown to be effective in patients infected with SARS-CoV. LPV/RTV-INFb also improved clinical parameters in marmosets and mice infected with MERS-CoV. Remarkably, the therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of LPV/RTV-INFb against MERS-CoV in a transgenic humanized mice model. The relatively high mortality rates associated with these three novel human coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, has suggested that pro-inflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis. It remains unknown whether the generated inflammatory state should be targeted. Therapeutics that target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly pathogenic infections. This minireview aimed to provide a summary of therapeutic compounds that showed potential in fighting SARS-CoV-2 infections.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Matsuda, Tomoko</author><author>Suzuki, Hikoyu</author><author>Ogata, Norichika</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Phylogenetic analyses of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reflected the several routes of invasion in Taiwan, the United States, and Japan</title><secondary-title>arXiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>arXiv</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08802</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Worldwide Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection is disrupting in the economy and anxiety of people.

The terrified people are asking the government for border measures. However, are border measures possible for this virus? By analysing 48 almost complete virus genome sequences, we found out that the viruses that invaded Taiwan, the United States, and Japan were introduced independently. We identified thirteen parsimony-informative sites and three groups (CTC, TCC, and TCT). Viruses found outside China did not form a monophyletic clade, opposite to previous study.

Within this library, ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed human coronavirus replication in cultured cells, but did not suppress replication of respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus. The effective concentration of ciclesonide to block SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19) replication (EC90) was 6.3 μM. After the eleventh consecutive MERS-CoV passage in the presence of ciclesonide, a resistant mutation was generated, which resulted in an amino acid substitution (A25V) in nonstructural protein (NSP) 15, as identified using reverse genetics. A recombinant virus with the mutation was also resistant to ciclesonide suppression of viral replication. These observations suggest that the effect of ciclesonide was specific to coronavirus, suggesting this is a candidate drug for treatment of patients suffering MERS or COVID-19.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCarty, Mark F.</author><author>DiNicolantonio, James J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nutraceuticals have potential for boosting the type 1 interferon response to RNA viruses including influenza and coronavirus</title><secondary-title>Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Prog Cardiovasc Dis</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.pcad.2020.02.007</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0033062020300372</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCloskey, B</author><author>Heymann, D L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SARS to novel coronavirus - old lessons and new lessons</title><secondary-title>Epidemiol Infect</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Epidemiol Infect</full-title></periodical><pages>e22</pages><volume>148</volume><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>Emerging Infectious Diseases</keyword><keyword>Sars</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>epidemic Response</keyword><keyword>lessons learned</keyword><keyword>novel</keyword><keyword>outbreak Response</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0950-2688</isbn><accession-num>32019614</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/s0950268820000254</electronic-resource-num><notes>1469-4409

Although the risk of infection in the US is currently low, it is important to understand the public perception of risk and trust in sources of information to better inform public health messaging. In this study, we surveyed the adult US population to understand their risk perceptions about the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods and Findings: We used an online platform to survey 718 adults in the US in early February 2020 using a questionnaire that we developed. Our sample was fairly similar to the general adult US population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity and education. We found that 69% of the respondents wanted the scientific/public health leadership (either the CDC Director or NIH Director) to lead the US response to COVID-19 outbreak as compared to 14% who wanted the political leadership (either the president or the Congress) to lead the response. Risk perception was low (median score of 5 out of 10) with the respondents trusting health professionals and health officials for information on COVID-19. Majority of the respondents were in favor of strict infection prevention policies to control the outbreak. Conclusion: Given our results, the public health/scientific leadership should be at the forefront of the COVID-19 response to promote trust. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No external funding received for this study ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

The coronavirus epidemic of 2019-2020, or COVID-19, is no exception, with the World Health Organization warning of a possible &quot;infodemic&quot; of fake news. In this study, we examine the alternative narratives around the coronavirus outbreak through advertisements promoted on Facebook, the largest social media platform in the US. Using the new Facebook Ads Library, we discover advertisers from public health and non-profit sectors, alongside those from news media, politics, and business, incorporating coronavirus into their messaging and agenda. We find the virus used in political attacks, donation solicitations, business promotion, stock market advice, and animal rights campaigning. Among these, we find several instances of possible misinformation, ranging from bioweapons conspiracy theories to unverifiable claims by politicians. As we make the dataset available to the community, we hope the advertising domain will become an important part of quality control for public health communication and public discourse in general.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meng, Tong</author><author>Cao, Hao</author><author>Zhang, Hao</author><author>Kang, Zijian</author><author>Xu, Da</author><author>Gong, Haiyi</author><author>Wang, Jing</author><author>Li, Zifu</author><author>Cui, Xingang</author><author>Xu, Huji</author><author>Wei, Haifeng</author><author>Pan, Xiuwu</author><author>Zhu, Rongrong</author><author>Xiao, Jianru</author><author>Zhou, Wang</author><author>Cheng, Liming</author><author>Liu, Jianmin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The insert sequence in SARS-CoV-2 enhances spike protein cleavage by TMPRSS</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.08.926006</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.08.926006</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>At the end of 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 induces an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia in China1, even more spread than SARS-CoV infection2. The entry of SARS-CoV into host cells mainly depends on the cell receptor (ACE2) recognition and spike protein cleavage-induced cell membrane fusion3,4. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 also binds to ACE2 with a similar affinity, whereas its spike protein cleavage remains unclear5,6. Here we show that an insertion sequence in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 enhances the cleavage efficiency, and besides pulmonary alveoli, intestinal and esophagus epithelium were also the target tissues of SARS-CoV-2. Compared with SARS-CoV, we found a SPRR insertion in the S1/S2 protease cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein increasing the cleavage efficiency by the protein sequence aligment and furin score calculation. Additionally, the insertion sequence facilitates the formation of an extended loop which was more suitable for protease recognition by the homology modeling and molicular docking. Furthermore, the single-cell transcriptomes identified that ACE2 and TMPRSSs are highly coexpressed in AT2 cells of lung, along with esophageal upper epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes. Our results provide the bioinformatics evidence for the increased spike protein cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 and indicate its potential target cells.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meng, Tong</author><author>Cao, Hao</author><author>Zhang, Hao</author><author>Kang, Zijian</author><author>Xu, Da</author><author>Gong, Haiyi</author><author>Wang, Jing</author><author>Li, Zifu</author><author>Cui, Xingang</author><author>Xu, Huji</author><author>Wei, Haifeng</author><author>Pan, Xiuwu</author><author>Zhu, Rongrong</author><author>Xiao, Jianru</author><author>Zhou, Wang</author><author>Cheng, Liming</author><author>Liu, Jianmin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The transmembrane serine protease inhibitors are potential antiviral drugs for 2019-nCoV targeting the insertion sequence-induced viral infectivity enhancement</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.08.926006</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.08.926006</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) induces an ongoing outbreak of pneumonia in China. The rapidly increasing infected cases suggest its effective transmission among humans, which largely depends on virus-binding host cell receptors and host cell proteases-cleaving virus spike protein. In order to identify the virus transmission of 2019-nCoV, the protease-induced spike protein cleavage ability between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV were compared. By protein sequence aligment and structure comparison, we found the key sequence of 675-QTQTNSPRRARSVAS-679 mediating 2019-nCoV spike protein cleavage. Its furin score (0.688) was higher than that of the corresponding sequence in SARS-CoV (0.139). In addition, the fragment of 680-SPRR-683 added two arginine hydrolysis sites (R682 and R683) on the surface and formed a loop for protease recognition. The molecular docking was based on the transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS), the main proteases in coronavirus cleavage. Furthermore, as the cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) and cell proteases TMPRSSs are located in the same cell, the single-cell transcriptomes of normal human lung and gastroenteric system were used. The ACE2 and TMPRSSs were highly co-expressed in absorptive enterocytes, upper epithelial cells of esophagus and lung AT2 cells. In conclusion, this study provides the bioinformatics evidence for the increased viral infectivity of 2019-nCoV and indicates alveolus pulmonis, intestinal epithelium and esophagus epithelium as the potential target tissues. Due to the important roles of TMPRSSs in 2019-nCoV infection, transmembrane serine protease inhibitors may be the potential antiviral treatment options for 2019-nCoV infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meo, S A</author><author>Alhowikan, A M</author><author>Al-Khlaiwi, T</author><author>Meo, I M</author><author>Halepoto, D M</author><author>Iqbal, M</author><author>Usmani, A M</author><author>Hajjar, W</author><author>Ahmed, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics comparison with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.</title><secondary-title>European review for medical and pharmacological sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European review for medical and pharmacological sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>2012-2019</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci</publisher><accession-num>32141570</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.26355/eurrev_202002_20379</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32141570</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>OBJECTIVE Human infections with zoonotic coronavirus contain emerging and reemerging pathogenic characteristics which have raised great public health concern. This study aimed at investigating the global prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of novel coronavirus, Wuhan China (2019-nCoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection outbreaks. MATERIALS AND METHODS The data on the global outbreak of &quot;2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV&quot; were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), concerned ministries and research institutes. We also recorded the information from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in ISI Web of Science and research centers on the prevalence, biological and clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. RESULTS Worldwide, SARS-CoV involved 32 countries, with 8422 confirmed cases and 916 (10.87%) casualties from November 2002 to August 2003. MERS-CoV spread over 27 states, causing 2496 cases and 868 (34.77%) fatalities during the period April 2012 to December 2019. However, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV spread swiftly the global borders of 27 countries. It infected 34799 people and resulted in 724 (2.08%) casualties during the period December 29, 2019 to February 7, 2020. The fatality rate of coronavirus MERS-CoV was (34.77%) higher than SARS-CoV (10.87%) and 2019-nCoV (2.08%); however, the 2019-nCoV transmitted rapidly in comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS The novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV has diverse epidemiological and biological characteristics, making it more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. It has affected more people in a short time period compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, although the fatality rate of MERS-CoV was higher than SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. The major clinical manifestations in coronavirus infections 2019-nCoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV are fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, generalized myalgia, malaise, drowsy, diarrhea, confusion, dyspnea, and pneumonia. Global health authorities should take immediate measures to prevent the outbreaks of such emerging and reemerging pathogens across the globe to minimize the disease burden locally and globally.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Metsky, Hayden C</author><author>Freije, Catherine A</author><author>Kosoko-Thoroddsen, Tinna-Solveig F</author><author>Sabeti, Pardis C</author><author>Myhrvold, Cameron</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CRISPR-based COVID-19 surveillance using a genomically-comprehensive machine learning approach</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.26.967026</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.26.967026</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The emergence and outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has rapidly become a global concern and has highlighted the need for fast, sensitive, and specific diagnostics.

We provide assay designs for detection of 67 viral species and subspecies, including: SARS-CoV-2, phylogenetically-related viruses, and viruses with similar clinical presentation. The designs are outputs of algorithms that we are developing for rapidly designing nucleic acid detection assays that are comprehensive across genomic diversity and predicted to be highly sensitive and specific. Of our design set, we experimentally screened 4 SARS-CoV-2 designs with a CRISPR-Cas13 detection system and then extensively tested the highest-performing SARS-CoV-2 assay. We demonstrate the sensitivity and speed of this assay using synthetic targets with fluorescent and lateral flow detection.

In anticipation of substantial burdens on healthcare system following this human-to-human spread, we aim to scrutinise the currently available information and evaluate the burden of healthcare systems during this outbreak in Wuhan. Methods and Findings We applied a modified SIR model to project the actual number of infected cases and the specific burdens on isolation wards and intensive care units (ICU), given the scenarios of different diagnosis rates as well as different public health intervention efficacy. Our estimates suggest, assuming 50% diagnosis rate if no public health interventions were implemented, that the actual number of infected cases could be much higher than the reported, with estimated 88,075 cases (as of 31st January, 2020), and projected burdens on isolation wards and ICU would be 34,786 and 9,346 respectively The estimated burdens on healthcare system could be largely reduced if at least 70% efficacy of public health intervention is achieved. Conclusion The health system burdens arising from the actual number of cases infected by the novel coronavirus appear to be considerable if no effective public health interventions were implemented. This calls for continuation of implemented anti-transmission measures (e.g., closure of schools and facilities, suspension of public transport, lockdown of city) and further effective large-scale interventions spanning all subgroups of populations (e.g., universal facemask wear) aiming at obtaining overall efficacy with at least 70% to ensure the functioning of and to avoid the breakdown of health system.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mistry, Dina</author><author>Litvinova, Maria</author><author>Piontti, Ana Pastore y</author><author>Chinazzi, Matteo</author><author>Fumanelli, Laura</author><author>Gomes, Marcelo F.

The growing need for realism in addressing complex public health questions is however calling for accurate models of the human contact patterns that govern the disease transmission processes. Here we present a data-driven approach to generate effective descriptions of population-level contact patterns by using highly detailed macro (census) and micro (survey) data on key socio-demographic features. We produce age-stratified contact matrices for 277 sub-national administrative regions of countries covering approximately 3.5 billion people and reflecting the high degree of cultural and societal diversity of the focus countries. We use the derived contact matrices to model the spread of airborne infectious diseases and show that sub-national heterogeneities in human mixing patterns have a marked impact on epidemic indicators such as the reproduction number and overall attack rate of epidemics of the same etiology. The contact patterns derived here are made publicly available as a modeling tool to study the impact of socio-economic differences and demographic heterogeneities across populations on the epidemiology of infectious diseases.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mizumoto, Kenji</author><author>Chowell, Gerardo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transmission potential of the New Corona (COVID-19) onboard the Princess Cruises Ship, 2020</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.24.20027649</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.24.20027649</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Using mathematical modeling and time-series incidence data describing the trajectory of the outbreak among passengers and crew members, we characterize the transmission potential of the COVID-19 outbreak aboard the Princess Cruises Ship, January-February 2020.

The cumulative number of reported deaths is at 637 as of February 7, 2020. Here we statistically estimated the time-delay adjusted death risk for Wuhan as well as for China excluding Wuhan to interpret the current severity of the epidemic in China. We found that the latest estimates of the death risk in Wuhan could be as high as 20% in the epicenter of the epidemic whereas we estimate it ~1% in the relatively mildly-affected areas. Because the elevated death risk estimates are likely associated with a breakdown of the medical/health system, enhanced public health interventions including social distancing and movement restrictions should be effectively implemented to bring the epidemic under control.

Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of emerging disease. The present study aimed to estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of 2019-nCov in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics. Methods: We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For estimation, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed nCov cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were used. Results: We found that our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China in 2019-2020 is calculated to be as high as 7.05 (95%CrI: 6.11-8.18) and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 has declined R to 3.24 (95%CrI: 3.16-3.32), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 983006 (95%CrI: 759475-1296258) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 9.8% (95%CrI: 7.6-13.0%). We also found that most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be 0.07% (95% CrI: 0.05%-0.09%) and 0.23% (95%CrI: 0.17-0.30%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR at 4.06% Conclusions: We have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of 2019-nCov in Wuhan, China, 2019-2020 using an ecological modelling approach. The power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems.

Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of emerging disease. The present study aimed to estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of 2019-nCov in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics. Methods: We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For estimation, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed nCov cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were used. Results: We found that our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China in 2019-2020 is calculated to be as high as 7.05 (95%CrI: 6.11-8.18) and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 has declined R to 3.24 (95%CrI: 3.16-3.32), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 983006 (95%CrI: 759475-1296258) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 9.8% (95%CrI: 7.6-13.0%). We also found that most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be 0.07% (95% CrI: 0.05%-0.09%) and 0.23% (95%CrI: 0.17-0.30%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR at 4.06% Conclusions: We have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of 2019-nCov in Wuhan, China, 2019-2020 using an ecological modelling approach. The power of our approach lies in the ability to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems.

We examined the age distribution of COVID-19 cases in Japan from January to March, 2020. Children are less likely to be diagnosed as cases, and moreover, the risk of disease given exposure among children appears to be low. Both the overall risk and the conditional risk of disease given exposure are likely to be the highest among adults aged from 50-69 years. The most plausible explanation that we believe is immune imprinting to a similar virus among adults.

There are limited case series reporting the impact on women affected by coronaviruses (CoV) during pregnancy. In women affected by SARS and MERS, the case fatality rate appeared higher in women affected in pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. We conducted a rapid, review to guide management of women affected by COVID -19 during pregnancy and developed interim practice guidance with the RCOG and RCPCH to inform maternity and neonatal service planning METHODS Searches were conducted in PubMed and MedRxiv to identify primary case reports, case series, observational studies or randomised-controlled trial describing women affected by coronavirus in pregnancy and on neonates. Data was extracted from relevant papers and the review was drafted with representatives of the RCPCH and RCOG who also provided expert consensus on areas where data were lacking RESULTS From 9964 results on PubMed and 600 on MedRxiv, 18 relevant studies (case reports and case series) were identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series concerning COVID-19, SARS, MERS and other coronaviruses. From reports of 19 women to date affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, delivering 20 babies, 3 (16%) were asymptomatic, 1 (5%) was admitted to ICU and no maternal deaths have been reported. Deliveries were 17 by caesarean section, 2 by vaginal delivery, 8 (42%) delivered pre-term. There was one neonatal death, in 15 babies who were tested there was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS Morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 appears less marked than for SARS and MERS, acknowledging the limited number of cases reported to date. Pre-term delivery affected 42% of women hospitalised with COVID-19, which may put considerable pressure on neonatal services if the UK reasonable worse-case scenario of 80% of the population affected is realised. There has been no evidence of vertical transmission to date. The RCOG and RCPCH have provided interim guidance to help maternity and neonatal services plan their response to COVID-19.

Moreover, mucosal epithelia such as that of the respiratory tract are protected by a layer of mucin polysaccharides, which are usually sulfated. Consequently, the polydisperse, natural products of heparan sulfate and the allied polysaccharide, heparin have been found to be involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here we use surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD) and heparin. The data demonstrate an interaction between the recombinant surface receptor binding domain and the polysaccharide. This has implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin and for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antivirals.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nadim, Sk Shahid</author><author>Ghosh, Indrajit</author><author>Chattopadhyay, Joydev</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Short-term predictions and prevention strategies for COVID-2019: A model based study</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08150</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>An outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus is ongoing till December 2019. As of March 16 2020, It has caused an epidemic outbreak with more than 1,79,073 confirmed infections and 7,074 reported deaths worldwide. During the period of an epidemic when human-to-human transmission is established and reported cases of coronavirus disease (COVID) are rising worldwide, forecasting is of utmost importance for health care planning and control the virus with limited resource. In this study, we propose and analyze a compartmental epidemic model of COVID to predict and control the outbreak. The basic reproduction number and control reproduction number are calculated analytically. A detailed stability analysis of the model is performed to observe the dynamics of the system. We calibrated the proposed model to fit daily data from five provinces of China namely, Hubei, Guangdong, Henan, Zhejiang and Hunan. Our findings suggest that independent self-sustaining human-to-human spread ($R_0&gt;1$, $R_c&gt;1$) is already present in all the five provinces. Short-term predictions show that the decreasing trend of new COVID cases is well captured by the model for all the five provinces. However, long term predictions for Hubei reveals that the symptomatic COVID cases will show oscillatory behaviour. Further, we found that effective management of quarantined individuals is more effective than management of isolated individuals to reduce the disease burden. Numerical results show that the modification factor for quarantine, modification factor for isolation and transmission rate are quite effective in reduction of the COVID cases in Hubei. Thus, COVID is controllable by reducing contacts with infected people and increasing the efficiency of quarantine and isolation. Health care officials should supply medications, protective masks and necessary human resources in the affected areas.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Neher, Richard A</author><author>Dyrdak, Robert</author><author>Druelle, Valentin</author><author>Hodcroft, Emma B</author><author>Albert, Jan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of seasonal forcing on a potential SARS-CoV-2 pandemic</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.13.20022806</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.13.20022806</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Neher et al. - 2020 - Impact of seasonal forcing on a potential SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first detected in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly since December 2019, causing over 45,000 PCR confirmed infections and more than 1,000 fatalities (as of Feb 12, 2020). Imported cases and small transmission clusters have been reported globally. Early data suggest the virus transmits readily and a pandemic cannot be ruled out. Data from routine diagnostics show a strong and consistent seasonal variation of the four endemic coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43). We use these data to explore the effect of seasonal variation in transmissibility on a potential SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A model allowing for many subpopulations of different size with variable parameters of SARS-CoV-2 spread shows how a pandemic could unfold in 2020-2022. Simulations of different scenarios show that plausible parameters result in a peak in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere in winter 2020/2021. A smaller range of parameters suggests a peak in the first half of 2020 or two peaks of similar magnitude. Variation in transmission and migration rates can result in substantial variation in prevalence between regions. While the uncertainty in parameters is large, the scenarios we explore show that transient reductions in the incidence rate might be due to a combination of seasonal variation and infection control efforts but do not necessarily mean the epidemic is contained. Seasonal forcing on SARS-CoV-2 should thus be taken into account in the further monitoring of the global transmission. The likely aggregated effect of seasonal variation, infection control measures, and transmission rate variation is a prolonged pandemic wave with lower prevalence at any given time, thereby providing a window of opportunity for better preparation of health care systems.

The epidemic outbreak cased by coronavirus 2019-nCoV is of great interest to researches because of the high rate of spread of the infection and the significant number of fatalities. A detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already interested in the questions of the duration of the epidemic, the expected number of patients and deaths. For long time predictions, the complicated mathematical models are necessary which need many efforts for unknown parameters identification and calculations. In this article, some preliminary estimates will be presented. Objective. Since the reliable long time data are available only for mainland China, we will try to predict the epidemic characteristics only in this area. We will estimate some of the epidemic characteristics and present the most reliable dependences for victim numbers, infected and removed persons versus time. Methods. In this study we use the known SIR model for the dynamics of an epidemic, the known exact solution of the linear equations and statistical approach developed before for investigation of the children disease, which occurred in Chernivtsi (Ukraine) in 1988-1989. Results. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified with the use of statistical approach. The numbers of infected, susceptible and removed persons versus time were predicted. Conclusions. Simple mathematical model was used to predict the characteristics of the epidemic caused by coronavirus 2019-nCoV in mainland China. The further research should focus on updating the predictions with the use of fresh data and using more complicated mathematical models.

A detailed scientific analysis of this phenomenon is still to come, but now it is urgently needed to evaluate the disease dynamics in order to organize the appropriate quarantine activities, to estimate the required number of places in hospitals, the level of individual protection, the rate of isolation of infected persons, etc. South Korea has achieved the stabilization of the number of cases at rather low level. The epidemic dynamics there can be compared with its development in other countries to make some preliminary, but very important conclusions. Here we provide a simple method of data comparison that can be useful for both governmental organizations and anyone.

Singapore adopted a multipronged surveillance strategy that included applying the case definition at medical consults, tracing contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, enhancing surveillance among different patient groups (all patients with pneumonia, hospitalized patients in intensive care units [ICUs] with possible infectious diseases, primary care patients with influenza-like illness, and deaths from possible infectious etiologies), and allowing clinician discretion (i.e., option to order a test based on clinical suspicion, even if the case definition was not met) to identify COVID-19 patients. Containment measures, including patient isolation and quarantine, active monitoring of contacts, border controls, and community education and precautions, were performed to minimize disease spread. As of March 5, 2020, a total of 117 COVID-19 cases had been identified in Singapore. This report analyzes the first 100 COVID-19 patients in Singapore to determine the effectiveness of the surveillance and containment measures. COVID-19 patients were classified by the primary means by which they were detected. Application of the case definition and contact tracing identified 73 patients, 16 were detected by enhanced surveillance, and 11 were identified by laboratory testing based on providers' clinical discretion. Effectiveness of these measures was assessed by calculating the 7-day moving average of the interval from symptom onset to isolation in hospital or quarantine, which indicated significant decreasing trends for both local and imported COVID-19 cases. Rapid identification and isolation of cases, quarantine of close contacts, and active monitoring of other contacts have been effective in suppressing expansion of the outbreak and have implications for other countries experiencing outbreaks.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nguyen, Duc Duy</author><author>Gao, Kaifu</author><author>Wang, Rui</author><author>Wei, Guowei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Machine intelligence design of 2019-nCoV drugs</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.30.927889</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.30.927889</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/04/2020.01.30.927889.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Wuhan coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV, is a newly emerged virus that infected more than 9692 people and leads to more than 213 fatalities by January 30, 2020.

Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection capacity for other countries compared to that of Singapore. We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% - 64%) of Singapore′s capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, if all countries had had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify likely case-detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases relative to Singapore among high surveillance locations is 40% (95% HPDI 22% - 67%), among intermediate surveillance locations it is 37% (95% HPDI 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance locations it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% - 42%). Using a simple mathematical model, we further find that treating all travelers as if they were residents (rather than accounting for the brief stay of some of these travelers in Wuhan) can modestly contribute to underestimation of prevalence as well. We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. Undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak.

The epidemic curve of a total of 199 confirmed cases was drawn, classifying individuals into passengers with and without close contact and crew members. A backcalculation method was employed to estimate the incidence of infection. The peak time of infection was seen for the time period from 2 to 4 February 2020, and the incidence has abruptly declined afterwards. The estimated number of new infections among passengers without close contact was very small from 5 February on which a movement restriction policy was imposed. Without the intervention from 5 February, it was predicted that the cumulative incidence with and without close contact would have been as large as 1373 (95% CI: 570, 2176) and 766 (95% CI: 587, 946) cases, respectively, while these were kept to be 102 and 47 cases, respectively. Based on an analysis of illness onset data on board, the risk of infection among passengers without close contact was considered to be very limited. Movement restriction greatly reduced the number of infections from 5 February onwards.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nishiura, Hiroshi</author><author>Kobayashi, Tetsuro</author><author>Miyama, Takeshi</author><author>Suzuki, Ayako</author><author>Jung, Sungmok</author><author>Hayashi, Katsuma</author><author>Kinoshita, Ryo</author><author>Yang, Yichi</author><author>Yuan, Baoyin</author><author>Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.</author><author>Linton, Natalie M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimation of the asymptomatic ratio of novel coronavirus infections (COVID-19)</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.03.20020248</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.03.20020248</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Nishiura et al. - 2020 - Estimation of the asymptomatic ratio of novel coronavirus infections (COVID-19).pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>A total of 565 Japanese citizens were evacuated from Wuhan, China to Japan.

Assuming that the mean detection window of the virus can be informed by the mean serial interval (estimated at 7.5 days), the ascertainment rate of infection was estimated at 9.2% (95% confidence interval: 5.0, 20.0). This indicates that the incidence of infection in Wuhan can be estimated at 20,767 infected individuals, including those with asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic infections. The infection fatality risk (IFR)-the actual risk of death among all infected individuals-is therefore 0.3% to 0.6%, which may be comparable to Asian influenza pandemic of 1957-1958.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nishiura, Hiroshi</author><author>Linton, Natalie M</author><author>Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Serial interval of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.03.20019497</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.03.20019497</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Nishiura, Linton, Akhmetzhanov - 2020 - Serial interval of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infections.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Objective: To estimate the serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) from information on 28 infector-infectee pairs. Methods: We collected dates of illness onset for primary cases (infectors) and secondary cases (infectees) from published research articles and case investigation reports. We subjectively ranked the credibility of the data and performed analyses on both the full dataset (n=28) and a subset of pairs with highest certainty in reporting (n=18). In addition, we adjusting for right truncation of the data as the epidemic is still in its growth phase. Results: Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, we estimated the median serial interval at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9). Limiting our data to only the most certain pairs, the median serial interval was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CrI: 3.5, 5.9). Conclusions: The serial interval of COVID-19 is shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement H.N. received funding support from Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development [grant number: JP18fk0108050] the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI in Japanese abbreviation) grant nos. 17H04701, 17H05808, 18H04895 and 19H01074, and the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) program [grant number: JPMJCR1413].

We show that closed environments contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19 and promote superspreading events. Closed environments are consistent with large-scale COVID-19 transmission events such as that of the ski chalet-associated cluster in France and the church- and hospital-associated clusters in South Korea. Our findings are also consistent with the declining incidence of COVID-19 cases in China, as gathering in closed environments was prohibited in the wake of the rapid spread of the disease. Reduction of unnecessary close contact in closed environments may help prevent large case clusters and superspreading events.

COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2) out of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China caught the world by surprise. As the outbreak began to spread outside of China, too little was known about the virus to model its transmission with any acceptable accuracy. World governments responded to rampant minformation about the virus leading to collatoral disasters, such as plunging financial markets, that could have been avoided if better models of the outbreak had been available. This is an engineering approach to model the spread of a new infectious disease from sparse data when little is known about the infectious agent itself. The most sought after estimate is the projected number of people who may be contagious, but still be within the incubation period thus remaining asymptomatic and undetected. This parameter is useful for estimating the extent of outbreak among a population over time and what to expect. It is thus important for common sense decision making by governments, organizations, and even individuals to contain, prepare, prevent, react, and safeguard. A Monte Carlo approach is implemented by using incubation period and a variable, called testing efficiency as variables. The Coronavirus outbreak in USA will be used to illustrate the implementation of this modeling approach. Among others it is demonstrated that imposing early travel restrictions from infected countries slowed down the outbreak in the USA by about 26 days.

The SARS-CoV-2 genome is different from that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, although also expected to spread differently according to meteorological conditions. Our main goal is to investigate the role of some meteorological variables on the expansion of this outbreak. In this study, an exponential model relating the number of accumulated confirmed cases and time was considered. The rate of COVID-19 spread, using as criterion the doubling time of the number of confirmed cases, was used as dependent variable in a linear model that took four independent meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed. Only China cases were considered, to control both cultural aspects and containment policies. Confirmed cases and the 4 meteorological variables were gathered between January 23 and March 1 (39 days) for the 31 provinces of Mainland China. Several periods of time were sampled for each province, obtaining more than one value for the rate of disease progression. Two different periods of time were tested, of 12 and 15 days, along with 3 and 5 different starting points in time, randomly chosen. The median value for each meteorological variable was computed, using the same time period; models with adjusted R square above 0.75 were selected. The rate of progression and doubling time were computed and used to fit a linear regression model. Models were evaluated using alpha=0.05. Results indicate that the doubling time correlates positively with temperature and inversely with humidity, suggesting that a decrease in the rate of progression of COVID-19 with the arrival of spring and summer in the north hemisphere. A 20oC increase is expected to delay the doubling time in 1.8 days. Those variables explain 18% of the variation in disease doubling time; the remaining 82% may be related to containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation or cultural aspects.

The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Protein-protein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor via which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. We used homology-based protein-protein docking, binding energy estimation, and decomposition, aiming to predict both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the interaction. Using in silico structural modelling, we brought additional evidence that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than mutation accumulation. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to hACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ouyang, Songying</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cryo-electron microscopy structure of the SADS-CoV spike glycoprotein provides insights into an evolution of unique coronavirus spike proteins</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.04.976258</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.04.976258</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The outbreak of a novel betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has aroused great public health concern. As a new coronavirus which was responsible for a large-scale outbreak of fatal disease in piglets in China, swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) originated from the same genus of horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) as SARS-CoV and possesses a broad species tropism. In addition to human cells, it can also infect cell lines from diverse species. Given the importance of the spike glycoprotein (S) protein in viral entry and host immune responses, here we report the cryo-EM structure of the SADS-CoV S in the prefusion conformation at a resolution of 3.55 angstrom. Our studies reveal that SADS-CoV S structure takes an intra-subunit quaternary packing mode where the NTD and CTD from the same subunit pack together by facing each other. The comparison of NTD and CTD with that of the other four genera gives the suggestion of the evolutionary procedure of the SADS-CoV S. Moreover, SADS-CoV S has several characteristic structural features, i.e., more compact architecture of S trimer, masking of epitopes by glycan shielding, which may facilitate to viral immune evasion. These data provide new insights into the evolutionary relationships of SADS-CoV S and would deepen our understanding of their structural and functional diversity which will facilitate to vaccine development.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pan, Jinhua</author><author>Yao, Ye</author><author>Liu, Zhixi</author><author>Li, Mengyi</author><author>Wang, Ying</author><author>Dong, Weizhen</author><author>Kan, Haidong</author><author>Wang, Weibing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effectiveness of control strategies for Coronavirus Disease 2019: a SEIR dynamic modeling study</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.19.20025387</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.19.20025387</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Pan et al. - 2020 - Effectiveness of control strategies for Coronavirus Disease 2019 a SEIR dynamic modeling study.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: Since its first cases occurrence in Wuhan, China, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spreading rapidly to other provinces and neighboring countries. A series of intervention strategies have been implemented, but didn't stop its spread. Methods: Two mathematical models have been developed to simulate the current epidemic situation in the city of Wuhan and in other parts of China. Special considerations were given to the mobility of people for the estimation and forecast the number of asymptomatic infections, symptomatic infections, and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse). Findings: The basic reproductive number (R0) was calculated for the period between 18 January 2020 and 16 February 2020: R0 declined from 5.75 to 1.69 in Wuhan and from 6.22 to 1.67 in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area). At the same time, Wuhan is estimated to observe a peak in the number of confirmed cases around 6 February 2020. The number of infected individuals in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area) peaked around February 3. The results also show that the peak of new asymptomatic cases per day in Wuhan occurred on February 6, and the peak of new symptomatic infections have occurred on February 3. Concurrently, while the number of confirmed cases nationwide would continue to decline, the number of real-time COVID-19 inpatients in Wuhan has reached a peak of 13,030 on February 14 before it decreases. The model further shows that the COVID-19 cases will gradually wane by the end of April 2020, both in Wuhan and the other parts of China. The number of confirmed cases would reach the single digit on March 27 in Wuhan and March 19 in the entire country. The five cities with top risk index in China with the exclusion of Wuhan are: Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Chongqing, and Xiangyang city. Interpretations: Although the national peak time has been reached, a significant proportion of asymptomatic patients and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse) still exist in the population, indicating the potential difficulty for the prevention and control of the disease. As the Return-to-Work tide is approaching and upgrading, further measures (e.g., escalatory quarantine, mask wearing when going out, and sit apart when taking vehicles) will be particularly crucial to stop the COVID-19 in other cities outside of Wuhan. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Clinical Trial This paper is not a clinical trials ### Funding Statement This study is sponsored by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1216424) and Shanghai Sailing Program (Grant No. 17YF142600). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Sixty-three confirmed patients were enrolled from December 30, 2019 to January 31, 2020. High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest was performed. The number of affected lobes, ground glass nodules (GGO), patchy/punctate ground glass opacities, patchy consolidation, fibrous stripes and irregular solid nodules in each patient's chest CT image were recorded. Additionally, we performed imaging follow-up of these patients. CT images of 63 confirmed patients were collected. M/F ratio: 33/30. The mean age was 44.9 ± 15.2 years. The mean number of affected lobes was 3.3 ± 1.8. Nineteen (30.2%) patients had one affected lobe, five (7.9%) patients had two affected lobes, four (6.3%) patients had three affected lobes, seven (11.1%) patients had four affected lobes while 28 (44.4%) patients had 5 affected lobes. Fifty-four (85.7%) patients had patchy/punctate ground glass opacities, 14 (22.2%) patients had GGO, 12 (19.0%) patients had patchy consolidation, 11 (17.5%) patients had fibrous stripes and 8 (12.7%) patients had irregular solid nodules. Fifty-four (85.7%) patients progressed, including single GGO increased, enlarged and consolidated; fibrous stripe enlarged, while solid nodules increased and enlarged. Imaging changes in novel viral pneumonia are rapid. The manifestations of the novel coronavirus pneumonia are diverse. Imaging changes of typical viral pneumonia and some specific imaging features were observed. Therefore, we need to strengthen the recognition of image changes to help clinicians to diagnose quickly and accurately. • High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest is critical for early detection, evaluation of disease severity and follow-up of patients with the novel coronavirus pneumonia. • The manifestations of the novel coronavirus pneumonia are diverse and change rapidly. • Radiologists should be aware of the various features of the disease and temporal changes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pan, Yunbao</author><author>Ye, Guangming</author><author>Zeng, Xiantao</author><author>Liu, Guohong</author><author>Zeng, Xiaojiao</author><author>Jiang, Xianghu</author><author>Zhao, Jin</author><author>Chen, Liangjun</author><author>Guo, Shuang</author><author>Deng, Qiaoling</author><author>Hong, Xiaoyue</author><author>Yang, Ying</author><author>Li, Yirong</author><author>Wang, Xinghuan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Can routine laboratory tests discriminate 2019 novel coronavirus infected pneumonia from other community-acquired pneumonia?</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.25.20024711</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.25.20024711</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background. The clinical presentation of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) infected pneumonia (NCIP) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We aimed to identify clinical laboratory features to distinguish NCIP from CAP. Methods. We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. Results. Most hematological and biochemical indexes of patients with NCIP were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability. Combinations of any two parameters performed better than did the RDW alone. Conclusions. Routine laboratory examinations may be helpful for the diagnosis of NCIP. Application of laboratory tests may help to optimize the use of isolation rooms for patients when they present with unexplained febrile respiratory illnesses.

It is timely to systematically review the potential of these interventions, including those for Middle East respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, to guide policymakers globally on their prioritization of resources for research and development. A systematic search was carried out in three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Supplementary strategies through Google Search and personal communications were used. A total of 27 studies fulfilled the criteria for review. Several laboratory protocols for confirmation of suspected 2019-nCoV cases using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been published. A commercial RT-PCR kit developed by the Beijing Genomic Institute is currently widely used in China and likely in Asia. However, serological assays as well as point-of-care testing kits have not been developed but are likely in the near future. Several vaccine candidates are in the pipeline. The likely earliest Phase 1 vaccine trial is a synthetic DNA-based candidate. A number of novel compounds as well as therapeutics licensed for other conditions appear to have in vitro efficacy against the 2019-nCoV. Some are being tested in clinical trials against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, while others have been listed for clinical trials against 2019-nCoV. However, there are currently no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations supported by high-level evidence.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Paraskevis, Dimitrios</author><author>Kostaki, Evangelia Georgia</author><author>Magiorkinis, Gkikas</author><author>Panayiotakopoulos, Georgios</author><author>Sourvinos, G.</author><author>Tsiodras, Sotirios</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Full-genome evolutionary analysis of the novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) rejects the hypothesis of emergence as a result of a recent recombination event</title><secondary-title>Infection, Genetics and Evolution</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Infection, Genetics and Evolution</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.26.920249</pages><volume>79</volume><keywords><keyword>Genomic sequence analysis</keyword><keyword>Molecular epidemiology</keyword><keyword>Novel coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Origin</keyword><keyword>Phylogenetic analysis</keyword><keyword>Recombination</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104212</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/27/2020.01.26.920249.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with human to human transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city of Wuhan in China. Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus. Methods: Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. Results: Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5′-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3′-part spanning 24,341–30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3′-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch. Conclusions: The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, Gun-Soo</author><author>Ku, Keunbon</author><author>Beak, Seung-Hwa</author><author>Kim, Seong Jun</author><author>Kim, Seung Il</author><author>Kim, Bum-Tae</author><author>Maeng, Jin-Soo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development of Reverse Transcription Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP) Assays Targeting SARS-CoV-2</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.09.983064</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.09.983064</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Epidemics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) now have more than 100,000 confirmed cases worldwide.

As the epidemic progresses, many disease modelers have focused on estimating the basic reproductive number R o, the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case in an otherwise susceptible population. The modeling approaches and resulting estimates of R o vary widely, despite relying on similar data sources. Aim We aimed to develop a framework for comparing and combining different estimates of R o across a wide range of models. Methods We reviewed 7 model-based analyses of the 2019-nCoV outbreak that were published online between January 23--26, 2020. We decompose their R o estimates into three key quantities: the exponential growth rate r , the mean generation interval, G bar, and the generation-interval dispersion κ. We use a Bayesian multilevel model to construct pooled estimates and measure uncertainties associated with these quantities. Results We find that most early estimates of R o rely on strong assumptions, especially about the generation-interval dispersion. Estimates that rely on narrow generation-interval distributions are overly sensitive to estimates of the exponential growth rate. Conclusion Our results emphasize the importance of propagating uncertainties in all components of R o, including the shape of the generation-interval distribution, in efforts to estimate R o at the outset of an epidemic. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement BMB and DJDE were supported by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC).

We show that the impact of asymptomatic transmission depends on generation intervals (i.e., time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person). If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R\_0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R\_0 will be under-estimated. We also show that as the length of asymptomatic generation intervals increase, estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase of the epidemic decrease. Our analysis provides a rationale for assessing the duration of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 in addition to their prevalence in the population.

Since December 2019, more than 69,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in China and quickly spreads to other counties. Currently, researchers put their best efforts to identify effective drugs for COVID-19. The neutralizing antibody, which binds to viral capsid in a manner that inhibits cellular entry of virus and uncoating of the genome, is the specific defense against viral invaders. In this study, we investigate to identify neutralizing antibodies that can bind to SARS-CoV-2 Sipke (S) protein and interfere with the interaction between viral S protein and a host receptor by bioinformatic methods. The sequence analysis of S protein showed two major differences in the RBD region of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV related bat viruses (btSARS-CoV). The insertion regions were close to interacting residues with the human ACE2 receptor. Epitope analysis of neutralizing antibodies revealed that SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used conformational epitopes, whereas MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies used a common linear epitope region, which contributes to form the β-sheet structure in MERS-CoV S protein and deleted in SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To identify effective neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, the binding affinities of neutralizing antibodies with SARS-CoV-2 S protein were predicted and compared by antibody-antigen docking simulation. The result showed that CR3022 neutralizing antibody from human may have higher binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than SARS-CoV S protein. We also found that F26G19 and D12 mouse antibodies could bind to SARS-CoV S protein with high affinity. Our findings provide crucial clues towards the development of antigen diagnosis, therapeutic antibody, and the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Patel, A</author><author>Jernigan, D B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Initial Public Health Response and Interim Clinical Guidance for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Outbreak - United States, December 31, 2019-February 4, 2020</title><secondary-title>MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep</full-title></periodical><pages>140-146</pages><volume>69</volume><issue>5</issue><edition>2020/02/07</edition><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0149-2195</isbn><accession-num>32027631</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.15585/mmwr.mm6905e1</electronic-resource-num><notes>1545-861x

On January 7, 2020, Chinese health officials confirmed that a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was associated with this initial cluster (1). As of February 4, 2020, a total of 20,471 confirmed cases, including 2,788 (13.6%) with severe illness,* and 425 deaths (2.1%) had been reported by the National Health Commission of China (2). Cases have also been reported in 26 locations outside of mainland China, including documentation of some person-to-person transmission and one death (2). As of February 4, 11 cases had been reported in the United States. On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General declared that the 2019-nCoV outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.(dagger) On January 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary declared a U.S. public health emergency to respond to 2019-nCoV.( section sign) Also on January 31, the president of the United States signed a &quot;Proclamation on Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons who Pose a Risk of Transmitting 2019 Novel Coronavirus,&quot; which limits entry into the United States of persons who traveled to mainland China to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents and their families (3). CDC, multiple other federal agencies, state and local health departments, and other partners are implementing aggressive measures to slow transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States (4,5). These measures require the identification of cases and their contacts in the United States and the appropriate assessment and care of travelers arriving from mainland China to the United States. These measures are being implemented in anticipation of additional 2019-nCoV cases in the United States. Although these measures might not prevent the eventual establishment of ongoing, widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare health care systems and the general public to be ready if widespread transmission with substantial associated illness occurs; and 3) better characterize 2019-nCoV infection to guide public health recommendations and the development of medical countermeasures including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely. As more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by CDC and state and local health departments.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Patino-Galindo, Juan Angel</author><author>Filip, Ioan</author><author>AlQuraishi, Mohammed</author><author>Rabadan, Raul</author><author>Patiño-Galindo, Juan Ángel</author><author>Filip, Ioan</author><author>AlQuraishi, Mohammed</author><author>Rabadan, Raul</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recombination and convergent evolution led to the emergence of 2019 Wuhan coronavirus</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.10.942748</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.10.942748</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Patiño-Galindo et al. - 2020 - Recombination and convergent evolution led to the emergence of 2019 Wuhan coronavirus.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The recent outbreak of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China, underscores the need for understanding the evolutionary processes that drive the emergence and adaptation of zoonotic viruses in humans. Here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human-infecting viruses like SARS and MERS, frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the Spike gene. We find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the 2019-nCoV involving the RBD. Compared with bat isolates, the recent ancestors of 2019-nCoV accumulated a high number of amino acid substitutions in the RBD and likewise in a region of polyprotein Orf1a that is critical for viral replication and transcription. Among these recent mutations, we identify amino acid substitutions common to the SARS 2003 outbreak isolates in positions 427N and 436Y, indicating potential adaptive convergent evolution. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that appears to interact with the human ACE2 receptor. In sum, we propose a two-hit scenario in the emergence of the 2019-nCoV virus whereby the 2019-nCoV ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of SARS by incorporation of a SARS-like RBD through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, those recombinants underwent convergent evolution.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peak, Corey M</author><author>Kahn, Rebecca</author><author>Grad, Yonatan H</author><author>Childs, Lauren M</author><author>Li, Ruoran</author><author>Lipsitch, Marc</author><author>Buckee, Caroline O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling the Comparative Impact of Individual Quarantine vs. Active Monitoring of Contacts for the Mitigation of COVID-19</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.05.20031088</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.05.20031088</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts are core disease control strategies, particularly for emerging infectious diseases such as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To estimate the comparative efficacy of these interventions to control COVID-19, we fit a stochastic branching model, comparing two sets of reported parameters for the dynamics of the disease. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically to social distancing. To the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, therefore, they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our model highlights the urgent need for more data on the serial interval and the extent of presymptomatic transmission in order to make data-driven policy decisions regarding the cost-benefit comparisons of individual quarantine vs. active monitoring of contacts.

Here, we propose a generalized SEIR model to analyze this epidemic. Based on the public data of National Health Commission of China from Jan. 20th to Feb. 9th, 2020, we reliably estimate key epidemic parameters and make predictions on the inflection point and possible ending time for 5 different regions. According to optimistic estimation, the epidemics in Beijing and Shanghai will end soon within two weeks, while for most part of China, including the majority of cities in Hubei province, the success of anti-epidemic will be no later than the middle of March. The situation in Wuhan is still very severe, at least based on public data until Feb. 15th. We expect it will end up at the beginning of April. Moreover, by inverse inference, we find the outbreak of COVID-19 in Mainland, Hubei province and Wuhan all can be dated back to the end of December 2019, and the doubling time is around two days at the early stage.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peng, Liangrong</author><author>Yang, Wuyue</author><author>Zhang, Dongyan</author><author>Zhuge, Changjing</author><author>Hong, Liu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemic analysis of COVID-19 in China by dynamical modeling</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.16.20023465</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.16.20023465</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) epidemic has attracted world- wide attention. Herein, we propose a mathematical model to analyzes this epidemic, based on a dynamic mechanism that incorporating the intrinsic impact of hidden la- tent and infectious cases on the entire process of transmission. Meanwhile, this model is validated by data correlation analysis, predicting the recent public data, and back- tracking, as well as sensitivity analysis. The dynamical model reveals the impact of various measures on the key parameters of the epidemic. According to the public data of NHCs from 01/20 to 02/09, we predict the epidemic peak and possible end time for 5 different regions. The epidemic in Beijing and Shanghai, Mainland/Hubei and Hubei/Wuhan, are expected to end before the end of February, and before mid- March respectively. The model indicates that, the outbreak in Wuhan is predicted to be ended in the early April. As a result, more effective policies and more efforts on clinical research are demanded. Moreover, through the backtracking simulation, we infer that the outbreak of the epidemic in Mainland/Hubei, Hubei/Wuhan, and Wuhan can be dated back to the end of December 2019 or the beginning of January 2020.

A solution would be significant as protein structure in-formation could be utilized in the medical field, e.g. in the development of vaccines for new viruses. This paper focuses on predicting the protein structure based on 3D images of the proteins captured through cryogenic electron microscopes (cryo-EM). A fully automated computationally efficient pro-tein structure prediction method would be particularly beneficial in the field of cryo-EM as the tech-nology allows researchers to photograph multiple large protein complexes in a single study, which means that a fast prediction method could allow for a high throughput of derived protein structures. We present a deep learning approach, DeepTracer, for predicting locations of the backbone atoms, secondary structure elements, and the amino acid types. In order to connect the predicted amino acids into chains, we applied a modified traveling salesman algorithm. Results: We trained our deep learning model on experimental cryo-EM density maps and tested it on a set of 50 density maps. We found that our new approach predicted protein structures with an average RMSD value of 1.18 and a coverage of 87.5%. Furthermore, we detected secondary struc-ture information for 87.2% of amino acids correctly. We also showed preliminarily that 25.2% of amino acid types could be predicted directly from the 3D cryo-EM density map, considering 20 dif-ferent types in total. Finally, we noted that the prediction runtime of DeepTracer is significantly im-proved compared to other methods. It predicts a large protein complex structure of more than 30,000 amino acids in only 2 hours.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pfaender, Stephanie</author><author>Mar, Katrina B</author><author>Michailidis, Eleftherios</author><author>Kratzel, Annika</author><author>Hirt, Dagny</author><author>V'kovski, Philip</author><author>Fan, Wenchun</author><author>Ebert, Nadine</author><author>Stalder, Hanspeter</author><author>Kleine-Weber, Hannah</author><author>Hoffmann, Markus</author><author>Hoffmann, H.

Host immune responses to CoV are complex and regulated in part through antiviral interferons. However, the interferon-stimulated gene products that inhibit CoV are not well characterized. Here, we show that interferon-inducible lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus E (LY6E) potently restricts cellular infection by multiple CoVs, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Mechanistic studies revealed that LY6E inhibits CoV entry into cells by interfering with spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Importantly, mice lacking Ly6e in hematopoietic cells were highly susceptible to murine CoV infection. Exacerbated viral pathogenesis in Ly6e knockout mice was accompanied by loss of hepatic and splenic immune cells and reduction in global antiviral gene pathways. Accordingly, we found that Ly6e directly protects primary B cells and dendritic cells from murine CoV infection. Our results demonstrate that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis. These findings advance our understanding of immune-mediated control of CoV in vitro and in vivo, knowledge that could help inform strategies to combat infection by emerging CoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pfefferle, Susanne</author><author>Reucher, Svenja</author><author>Nörz, Dominic</author><author>Lütgehetmann, Marc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of a quantitative RT-PCR assay for the detection of the emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 using a high throughput system</title><secondary-title>Eurosurveillance</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Eurosurveillance</full-title></periodical><volume>25</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Euro Surveill</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.9.2000152</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.9.2000152</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pham, Katherine Hoffmann</author><author>Luengo-Oroz, Miguel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>From plague to coronavirus: On the value of ship traffic data for epidemic modeling</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02253</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>In addition to moving people and goods, ships can spread disease. Ship traffic may complement air traffic as a source of import risk, and cruise ships - with large passenger volumes and multiple stops - are potential hotspots, in particular for diseases with long incubation periods. Vessel trajectory data from ship Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) is available online and it is possible to extract and analyze this data. We illustrate this in the case of the current coronavirus epidemic, in which hundreds of infected individuals have traveled in ships captured in the AIS dataset.

To acquire the epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 in Guizhou, China, we collected data on 162 laboratory-confirmed cases related to COVID-19. We described the demographic characteristics of the cases and estimated the incubation period, serial interval and basic reproduction number. We also presented two representative case studies in Guizhou province -- Case Study 1 was an example of asymptomatic carrier; and Case Study 2 was an example of a large and complex infection chain that involved four different districts spanning three provinces and eight families. With an estimation of 8 days incubation period and 6 days serial interval, our results indicate that there may exist infectiousness during the incubation period for 2019-nCoV. This increases the difficulty of screening or identifying cases related to COVID-19.

We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized importations timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation, and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the upcoming weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since the first importation, however 6 cases out of 10 were estimated to go undetected. Countries outside China should be prepared for the possible emergence of several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions.

In this study, we integrated sequence information and RNA expression of genes within the QTL to identify mucin 4 (Muc4) as a high priority candidate for controlling SARS-CoV titer in the lung. To test this hypothesis, we infected Muc4-/- mice and found that female, but not male, Muc4-/- mice developed more weight loss and disease following infection with SARS-CoV. Female Muc4-/- mice also had more difficulty breathing despite reduced lung pathology; however, no change in viral titers was observed. Comparing across viral families, studies with chikungunya virus, a mosquito-borne arthralgic virus, suggests that Muc4's impact on viral pathogenesis may be widespread. Although not confirming the original titer QTL, our data identifies a role for Muc4 in the SARS-CoV disease and viral pathogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Porcheddu, Rossella</author><author>Serra, Caterina</author><author>Kelvin, David</author><author>Kelvin, Nikki</author><author>Rubino, Salvatore</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Similarity in Case Fatality Rates (CFR) of COVID-19/SARS-COV-2 in Italy and China</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Infection in Developing Countries</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Infection in Developing Countries</full-title></periodical><pages>125-128</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>02</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>J Infect Dev Ctries</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.3855/jidc.12600</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://jidc.org/index.php/journal/article/view/12600</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>&lt;p&gt;As of 28 February 2020, Italy had 888 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with most cases in Northern Italy in the Lombardia and Veneto regions. Travel-related cases were the main source of COVID-19 cases during the early stages of the current epidemic in Italy. The month of February, however, has been dominated by two large clusters of outbreaks in Northern Italy, south of Milan, with mainly local transmission the source of infections. Contact tracing has failed to identify patient zero in one of the outbreaks. As of 28 February 2020, twenty-one cases of COVID-19 have died. Comparison between case fatality rates in China and Italy are identical at 2.3. Additionally, deaths are similar in both countries with fatalities in mostly the elderly with known comorbidities.

Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures and efforts in response to the outbreak. METHODS: We quantified the effects of control measures on population contact patterns in Wuhan, China, to assess their effects on the progression of the outbreak. We included the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model fitted to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in the age-structured epidemic framework. Further, we looked at the age-distribution of cases. Lastly, we simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way, and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak. FINDINGS: Changes in mixing patterns may have contributed to reducing the number of infections in mid-2020 by 92% (interquartile range: 66-97%). There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of reducing the height of the peak, overall epidemic size in mid-2020 and probability that a second peak may occur after return to work. However, the modelled effects of social distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children play in the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would likely contribute to the reduction and delay the epidemic size and peak, respectively. However, there are some limitations to the analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.

Unfortunately, most of the existing models are either too fine-grained to be efficient or too coarse-grained to be reliable. Here we propose a computationally efficient hybrid approach that uses SIR model for individual cities which are in turn coupled via empirical transportation networks that facilitate migration among them. The treatment presented here differs from existing models in two crucial ways: first, self-consistent determination of coupling parameters so as to maintain the populations of individual cities, and second, the incorporation of distance dependent temporal delays in migration. We apply our model to Indian aviation as well as railway networks taking into account populations of more than 300 cities. Our results project that through the domestic transportation, the significant population is poised to be exposed within 90 days of the onset of epidemic. Thus, serious supervision of domestic transport networks is warranted even after restricting international migration.

Till date, no vaccine or completely effective drug is available for the cure of COVID-19. Therefore, an effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 is needed to be design. This study was conducted to design an effective multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) against SARS-COV-2. Seven antigenic proteins were taken as a target and epitopes (B cell, IFN- γ and T cell) were predicted. Highly antigenic and overlapping epitopes were shortlisted. Selected T cell epitopes indicated significant interactions with the HLA-binding alleles and 99.29% coverage of the worlds population. Finally, 505 amino acids long MEV was designed by connecting sixteen MHC class I and twelve MHC class II epitopes with suitable linkers and adjuvant. Linkers and adjuvant were added to enhance the immunogenicity response of the vaccine. The allergenicity, physiochemical properties, antigenicity and structural details of MEV were analyzed in order to ensure safety and immunogenicity. MEV construct was non-allergenic and antigenic. Molecular docking demonstrated a stable and strong binding affinity of MEV with TLR3 and TLR8. Codon optimization and in silico cloning ensured increased expression in the Escherichia coli K-12 system. However, to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile, the proposed vaccine needs to be experimentally validated.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qi, Di</author><author>Yan, Xiaofeng</author><author>Tang, Xumao</author><author>Peng, Junnan</author><author>Yu, Qian</author><author>Feng, Longhua</author><author>Yuan, Guodan</author><author>Zhang, An</author><author>Chen, Yaokai</author><author>Yuan, Jing</author><author>Huang, Xia</author><author>Zhang, Xianxiang</author><author>Hu, Peng</author><author>Song, Yuyan</author><author>Qian, Chunfang</author><author>Sun, Qiangzhong</author><author>Wang, Daoxin</author><author>Tong, Jin</author><author>Xiang, Jianglin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological and clinical features of 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease cases in Chongqing municipality, China: a retrospective, descriptive, multiple-center study</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.01.20029397</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.01.20029397</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background：In January 19, 2020, first case of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia (COVID-19) was confirmed in Chongqing municipality, China.

Results：267 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to 3 designated-hospitals in Chongqing provincial municipality from January 19 to February 16, 2020 were enrolled and categorized on admission. 217 (81.27%) and 50 (18.73%) patients were categorized into non-severe and severe subgroups, respectively. The median age of patients was 48.0 years (IQR, 35.0-65.0), with 129 (48.3%) of the patients were more than 50 years of age. 149 (55.8%) patients were men. Severe patients were significantly older (median age, 71.5 years [IQR, 65.8-77.0] vs 43.0 years [IQR, 32.5-57.0]) and more likely to be male (110 [50.7%] vs 39 [78.0%]) and have coexisting disorders (15 [30.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]). 41 (15.4%) patients had a recent travel to Hubei province, and 139 (52.1%) patients had a history of contact with patients from Hubei. On admission, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever 225(84.3%), fatigue (208 [77.9%]), dry cough (189 [70.8%]), myalgia or arthralgia (136 [50.9%]). Severe patients were more likely to present dyspnea (17 [34.0%] vs 26 [12.0%]) and confusion (10 [20.0%] vs 15 [6.9%]). Rales (32 [12.0%]) and wheezes (20 [7.5%]) are not common noted for COVID-19 patients, especially for the non-severe (11 [5.1%], 10 [4.6%]). 118 (44.2%). Most severe patients demonstrated more laboratory abnormalities. 231 (86.5%), 61 (22.8%) patients had lymphopenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. CD4+T cell counts decrease was observed in 77.1 % of cases, especially in the severe patients (45, 100%). 53.1% patients had decreased CD+3 T cell counts, count of CD8+T cells was lower than the normal range in part of patients (34.4%). More severe patients had lower level of CD4+ T cells and CD+3 T cells (45 [100.0%] vs 29[56.9%], 31 [68.9%] vs 20 [39.2%]). Most patients had normal level of IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α and INF-γ, while high level of IL-6 and IL-17A was common in COVID-19 patients (47 [70.1%], 35 [52.2%]). Level of IL-6, IL-17A and TNF-α was remarkably elevated in severe patients (32 [84.2%] vs 15 [51.7%], 25 [65.8%] vs 10 [34.5%], 17 [44.7%] vs 5 [17.2%]). All patients received antiviral therapy (267, 100%). A portion of severe patients (38, 76.0%) received systemic corticosteroid therapy. Invasive mechanical ventilation in prone position, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was adopted only in severe patients with respiratory failure (5[10.0%], 35[70.0%], 12[24.0%]). Traditional Chinese medicine was adopted to most of severe patients (43,86.0%). Conclusion:Our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of COVID-19 in Chongqing municipality and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and non-severe patients. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing is 1.5%, lower than that of Hubei province and mainland China including Hubei province. However, the 28-mortality of severe patients was relatively high, with much higher when complications occurred. Notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as 44.4%. Therefore, early diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially those combined with ARDS, will be considerably essential to reduce mortality. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant NO. 81670071) and the National Natural Science Foundation for Young Scholars of China (Grant NO. 81800083). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by 2019-nCov to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. 2019-nCoV may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted &quot;CellPhoneDB&quot; analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qi, Jing</author><author>Xu, Jing</author><author>Li, Bozhi</author><author>Huang, Jinsha</author><author>Yang, Yuan</author><author>Zhang, Zhentao</author><author>Yao, Dongai</author><author>Liu, Qunhui</author><author>Jia, Min</author><author>Gong, Daokai</author><author>Ni, Xiaohong</author><author>Zhang, Qimei</author><author>Shang, Furong</author><author>Xiong, Nian</author><author>Zhu, Chunli</author><author>Wang, Tao</author><author>Zhang, Xi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Evaluation of Sleep Disturbances for Chinese Frontline Medical Workers Under the Outbreak of COVID-19</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.06.20031278</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.06.20031278</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Objective To evaluate sleep disturbances of Chinese frontline medical workers (fMW) under the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019, and make a comparison with non-fMW. Methods The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, were volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status of fMW. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI&gt;7 points or/and AIS&gt;6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS and prevalence of sleep disturbances between fMW and non-fMW. Subgroup analysis for different gender in fMW was conducted. Results A total of 1306 subjects (including 801 fMW and 505 non-fMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-fMW, fMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.3 vs 7.5, P＜0.001), AIS (6.9 vs 5.3, P＜0.001), anxiety (4.9 vs 4.3, P＜0.001) and depression (4.1 vs 3.6, P=0.001), and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI &gt; 7 points (67.2% vs 47.7%, P＜0.001) and AIS &gt; 6 points (51.7% vs 35.6%, P＜0.001). In subgroup analysis, compared to male fMW, female fMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.4 vs 8.6, P=0.022) and higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI &gt; 7 points (70.3% vs 54.6%, P&lt;0.001). Conclusion fMW had higher prevalence of sleep disturbances and worse sleep quality than non-fMW. Female fMW were more vulnerable to having sleep disturbances than male fMW.

This study aims to calculate its case fatality rate (CFR). Methods: The method was based on the formula of dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases T days before, where T was an average time period from case confirmation to death. It was found that supposing a T, if it was smaller (bigger) than the true T, calculated CFRs would gradually increase (decrease) to infinitely near the true CFR with time went on. According to the law, the true T value could be determined by trends of daily CFRs calculated with different assumed T values (left of true T is decreasing, right is increasing). Then the CFR could be calculated. Results: CFR of COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province was 0.8%. So far, the CFR and T value (T was 9) had accurately predicted the death numbers more than two weeks continuously. CFR in Hubei of China was 5% by which (and T = 5) the calculated death number corresponded with the reported number in the last week. Conclusions: The method could be used for diseases to calculate CFR without requiring the end of pandemics. Dynamic monitor of the assumed CFRs trends could help outbreak-controller have a clear vision of the case-confirmation situation.

Design Cross-sectional Setting Multicenter Participants A total of 52 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their initial CT images were enrolled from 5 designated hospitals in Ankang, Lishui, Zhenjiang, Lanzhou, and Linxia between January 23, 2020 and February 8, 2020. As of February 20, patients remained in hospital or with non-findings in CT were excluded. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included in the final analysis. Intervention CT radiomics models based on logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were developed on features extracted from pneumonia lesions in training and inter-validation datasets. The predictive performance was further evaluated in test dataset on lung lobe- and patients-level. Main outcomes Short-term hospital stay (≤10 days) and long-term hospital stay (&gt;10 days). Results The CT radiomics models based on 6 second-order features were effective in discriminating short- and long-term hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with areas under the curves of 0.97 (95%CI 0.83-1.0) and 0.92 (95%CI 0.67-1.0) by LR and RF, respectively, in the test dataset. The LR model showed a sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 and 0.89, and the RF model showed similar performance with sensitivity and specificity of 0.75 and 1.0 in test dataset. Conclusions The machine learning-based CT radiomics models showed feasibility and accuracy for predicting hospital stay in patients with pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

DESIGN Retrospective case series. SETTING Five hospitals in east of Zhejiang province, China. PARTICIPANTS 88 cases of laboratory-confirmed and 3 cases of clinical-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to hospital. Data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 11 February 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES A team of physicians who had been treating these patients extracted and recorded the exposure history, clinical symptoms, chest computed tomography and laboratory findings from medical records and sent the data to the working group in Ningbo to review and calculate. RESULTS Of all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 while 3 (3.30%) were clinical-diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia cases. The median age of the patients was 50 (36.5-57) years, and female accounted for 59.34%. In this sample 40 (43.96%) patients had contracted the diseases from local cases, 31 (34.07%) patients had been to Wuhan/Hubei, 8 (8.79%) cases had contacted with people from Wuhan, 11 (12.09%) cases were confirmed aircraft transmission. In particular within the city of Ningbo, 60.52% cases can be traced back to an event held in a temple. The most common symptoms were fever (71.43%), cough (60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%). The median of incubation period was 6 (IQR, 3-8) days and the median time from first visit to a doctor to confirmed diagnosis was 1 (1-2) days. According to the Chest computed tomography scans, 67.03% cases had bilateral pneumonia, and 27.47% cases showed unilateral pneumonia. CONCLUSION Social activity cluster, family cluster and travel by airplane were how COVID-19 patients get transmitted and could be rapidly diagnosed COVID-19 in Zhejiang. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No funding. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Although this risky pneumonia with high infection rates and high mortality rates need to be resolved immediately, major gaps in our knowledge of clinical characters of it were still not be established. The aim of this study is to summaries and analysis the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV pneumonia. Methods: Literature have been systematically performed a search on PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, GreyNet International, and The Cochrane Library from inception up to February 8, 2020. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess quality, and publication bias was analyzed by Egger test. In the single-arm meta-analysis, A fix-effects model was used to obtain a pooled incidence rate. We conducted subgroup analysis according to geographic region and research scale. Results: A total of nine studies including 356 patients were included in this study, the mean age was 52.4 years and 221 (62.1%) were male. The pooled incidences rate of symptoms as follows: pharyngalgia (12.2%, 95% CI: 0.087-0.167), diarrhea (9.2%, 95% CI: 0.062-0.133) and headache (8.9%, 95% CI: 0.063-0.125). Meanwhile, 5.7% (95% CI: 0.027-0.114) of patients were found without any symptoms although they were diagnosed by RT-PCR. In the terms of CT imaging examination, the most of patients showed bilateral mottling or ground-glass opacity, 8.6% (95% CI: 0.048-0.148) of patients with crazy-paving pattern, and 11.5% (95% CI: 0.064-0.197) of patients without obvious CT imaging presentations. The pooled incidence of mortality was 8.9% (95% CI: 0.062-0.126). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first evidence-based medicine research to further elaborate the clinical characteristics of NCIP, which is beneficial to the next step of prevention and treatment.

Results: The prevalence rates of moderate or severe anxiety (score ≥10 on GAD-7) were 32.7% (n=167) among Wuhan participants and 20.4% (n=102) among Shanghai participants. 78.6% (n=401) of Wuhan participants and 63.9% (n=320) of Shanghai participants had carried out all six precautionary behaviors. For both measures, Wuhan participants were more responsive to the outbreak (p&lt;0.001). Controlling for personal characteristics, logistic regression results suggested that risks of moderate or severe anxiety were positively associated with perceived susceptibility (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.8) and severity of the disease (1.6, 1.4-1.9) and confusion about information reliability (1.6, 1.5-1.9). Having confidence in taking measures to protect oneself against the disease was associated with a lower risk (0.6, 0.5-0.7). The strongest predictor of behavioral change was perceived severity (1.2, 1.1-1.4), followed by confusion about information reliability (1.1, 1.0-1.3). Conclusions: Psychological and behavioral responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our results support efforts for timely dissemination of accurate and reliable information to address the high anxiety level.

CoV infection requires spike proteins, which bind viruses to host cell receptors and catalyze virus-cell membrane fusion. Several CoV strains have spike proteins with two receptor-binding domains, an S1A that engages host sialic acids and an S1B that recognizes host transmembrane proteins. As this bivalent binding may enable broad zoonotic CoV infection, we aimed to identify roles for each receptor in distinct infection stages. Focusing on two betacoronaviruses, murine JHM-CoV and human Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), we found that virus particle binding to cells was mediated by sialic acids; however, the transmembrane protein receptors were required for a subsequent virus infection. These results favored a two-step process in which viruses first adhere to sialic acids and then require subsequent engagement with protein receptors during infectious cell entry. However, sialic acids sufficiently facilitated the later stages of virus spread through cell-cell membrane fusion, without requiring protein receptors. This virus spread in the absence of the prototype protein receptors was increased by adaptive S1A mutations. Overall, these findings reveal roles for sialic acids in virus-cell binding, viral spike protein-directed cell-cell fusion, and resultant spread of CoV infections.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qiu, Chengfeng</author><author>Xiao, Qian</author><author>Liao, Xin</author><author>Deng, Ziwei</author><author>Liu, Huiwen</author><author>Shu, Yuanlu</author><author>Zhou, Dinghui</author><author>Deng, Ye</author><author>Wang, Hongqiang</author><author>Zhao, Xiang</author><author>Zhou, Jianliang</author><author>Wang, Jin</author><author>Shi, Zhihua</author><author>Da, Long</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transmission and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in 104 outside-Wuhan patients, China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.04.20026005</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.04.20026005</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: Cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emigrated from Wuhan escalated the risk of spreading in other cities. This report focused on the outside-Wuhan patients to assess the transmission and clinical characteristics of this illness. Methods: Contact investigation was conducted on each patient who admitted to the assigned hospitals in Hunan Province (geographically adjacent to Wuhan) from Jan 22, 2020 to Feb 12, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, medication therapy and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Patients were confirmed by PCR test. Results: Of the 104 patients, 48 (46.15%) were imported cases and 56 (53.85%) were indigenous cases; 93 (89.42%) had a definite contact history with infections. Family clusters were the major body of patients. Transmission along the chain of 3 &amp;ldquo:generations” was observed. Mean age was 43 (rang, 8-84) years (including 3 children) and 49 (47.12%) were male. Most patients had typical symptoms, 5 asymptomatic infections were found and 2 of them infected their relatives. The median incubation period was 6 (rang, 1-32) days, of 8 patients ranged from 18 to 32 days. Just 9 of 16 severe patients required ICU care. Until Feb 12, 2020, 40 (38.46%) discharged and 1 (0.96%) died. For the antiviral treatment, 80 (76.92%) patients received traditional Chinese medicine therapy. Conclusions: Family but not community transmission occupied the main body of infections in the two centers. Asymptomatic transmission demonstrated here warned us that it may bring more risk to the spread of COVID-19. The incubation period of 8 patients exceeded 14 days.

Methods: Using Baidu Index Platform (http://index.baidu.com) and the website of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention as data resources to obtain the search volume (SV) of keywords for symptoms associated with COVID-19 from January 1 to February 20 in each year from 2017 to 2020, in Hubei province and other top 10 impacted provinces in China and the epidemic data. Data of 2020 were compared with the previous three years. Data of Hubei province were compared with confirmed cases. The differences and characteristics of the SV of COVID-19-related symptoms, and the correlation between the SV of COVID-19 and new confirmed or suspected cases were analyzed and the hysteresis effects were discussed. Results: Compared the data from January 1 to February 20, 2020, with the SV for the same period of previous three years, Hubei's SV for cough, fever, diarrhea, chest tightness, dyspnea and other symptoms were significantly increased. The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms was significantly higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms (P&lt;0.001). The SV of COVID-19 in Hubei province was significantly correlated with new confirmed or suspected cases (R(confirmed) = 0.723, R(suspected) = 0.863, all P &lt; 0.001). The results of the distributed lag model suggested that the patients who retrieved relevant symptoms on the Internet may begin to see a doctor in 2-3 days later and be diagnosed in 3-4 days later. Conclusions: The total SV of lower respiratory symptoms is higher than that of upper respiratory symptoms, and the SV of diarrhea also increased significantly. It warns us to pay attention to not only the symptoms of lower respiratory tract, but also the gastrointestinal symptoms, especially diarrhea in patients with COVID-19. There is a relationship between Internet retrieval behavior and the number of new confirmed or suspected cases. Big data has a certain role in the early warning of infectious diseases. 目的： 探索新型冠状病毒肺炎（新冠肺炎）的症状特征，提高新冠肺炎防控意识。 方法： 通过互联网搜索引擎收录的关键词检索数据（百度指数）及中国疾病预防控制中心公布的疫情相关数据，选取2017—2020年每年1月1日至2月20日期间新冠肺炎相关症状关键词的搜索量及2020年1月20日至3月5日的新增确诊及新增疑似病例数，分析新冠肺炎相关症状的搜索量差异及其特征，分析新冠肺炎百度指数与新增确诊、新增疑似的相关性，并探讨网络检索热度的滞后效应。2020年的数据与2017—2019年的数据进行比较，湖北省的数据与确诊人数第2至第10位的9个省份的数据进行比较。 结果： 将2020年1月20日至2月20日期间的搜索量与往年（2017—2019年）同期的搜索量均值相比，发现湖北省民众对咳嗽、发热、腹泻、胸闷、呼吸困难等症状的搜索量大幅升高。下呼吸道症状的总检索量明显高于上呼吸道症状的总检索量（P&lt;0.001）。湖北省新冠肺炎百度指数与新增确诊及新增疑似具有明显相关性（r(s确诊)=0.723，r(s疑似)=0.863，P值均&lt;0.001）。分布滞后模型结果提示在互联网上检索相关症状的感染者可能在后来的2～3 d左右开始就诊并成为疑似病例，3～4 d左右确诊。 结论： 疫情期间湖北省民众对下呼吸道症状的总检索量较上呼吸道症状的总检索量增多，而且腹泻症状的检索量亦显著升高，警示我们除了关注下呼吸道症状，也应该重视新冠肺炎患者腹泻等消化道症状。互联网检索大数据与新增确诊数、新增疑似数存在相关性，提示其对于传染性疾病具有一定的预警作用。.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qiu, Ruijin</author><author>Wei, Xuxu</author><author>Zhao, Mengzhu</author><author>Zhong, Changming</author><author>Zhao, Chen</author><author>Hu, Jiayuan</author><author>Li, Min</author><author>Huang, Ya</author><author>Han, Songjie</author><author>He, Tianmai</author><author>Chen, Jing</author><author>Shang, Hongcai</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Outcome reporting from protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): a review</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.04.20031401</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.04.20031401</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Objectives: To examine heterogeneity of outcomes in protocols of clinical trials of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to identify outcomes for prioritization in developing a core outcome set (COS) in this field. Design: This study is a review. Data sources: Databases of ICMJE-accepted clinical trial registry platform were searched on February 14, 2020. Eligibility Criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of COVID-19 were considered.Conditions of patients include common type, severe type or critical type. Interventions include traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine. We excluded trials that for discharged patients, psychological intervention and complications of COVID-19. Data extraction and synthesis: The general information and outcomes, outcome measurement instruments and measurement times were extracted. The results were analysed by descriptive analysis. Results: 19 registry platforms were searched. A total of 97 protocols were included from 160 protocols. For protocols of TCM clinical trials, 76 outcomes from 16 outcome domains were reported, and almost half (34/76, 44.74%) of outcomes were reported only once; the most frequently reported outcome was time of SARS-CoV-2 RNA turns to negative. 27 (27/76, 35.53%) outcomes were provided one or more outcome measurement instruments. 10 outcomes were provided one or more measurement time frame. For protocols of western medicine clinical trials, 126 outcomes from 17 outcome domains were reported; almost half (62/126, 49.21%) of outcomes were reported only once; the most frequently reported outcome was proportion of patients with negative SARS-CoV-2. 27 outcomes were provided one or more outcome measurement instruments. 40 (40/126, 31.75%) outcomes were provided one or more measurement time frame. Conclusion: Outcome reporting in protocols of clinical trials of COVID-19 is inconsistent. Thus, developing a core outcome set is necessary. Keywords: Outcomes; clinical trials, COVID-19; review.

The Chinese government responded to this epidemic with multiple public health policies including locking down the city of Wuhan, establishing multiple temporary hospitals, and prohibiting public gathering events. Here, we constructed a new real-time status dynamic model of SEIO (MH) to reveal the influence of national public health policies and to model the epidemic in Wuhan. Methods A real-time status dynamic model was proposed to model the population of Wuhan in status Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected with symptoms (I), with Medical care (M), and Out of the system (O) daily. Model parameters were fitted according to the daily report of new infections from Jan. 27th, 2020 to Feb. 2nd, 2020. Using the fitted parameters, the epidemic under different conditions was simulated and compared with the current situation. Finding According to our study, the first patient is most likely appeared on Nov. 29th, 2019. There had already been 4,153 infected people and 6,536 exposed ones with the basic reproduction number R\_0 of 2.65 before lockdown, whereas R\_0 dropped to 1.98 for the first 30 days after the lockdown. The peak point is Feb. 17th, 2020 with 24,115 infected people and the end point is Jun. 17th, 2020. In total, 77,453 people will be infected. If lockdown imposed 7 days earlier, the total number of infected people would be 21,508, while delaying the lockdown by 1-6 days would expand the infection scale 1.23 to 4.94 times. A delay for 7 days would make the epidemic finally out of control. Doubling the number of beds in hospitals would decrease the total infections by 28%, and further investment in bed numbers would yield a diminishing return. Last, public gathering events that increased the transmission parameter by 5% in one single day would increase 4,243 infected people eventually. Interpretation Our model forecasted that the peak time in Wuhan was Feb. 17th, 2020 and the epidemic in Wuhan is now under control. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is currently a global public health threat for all nations. Multiple countries including South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, and the United States are suffering from SARS-CoV-2. Our study, which simulated the epidemic in Wuhan, the first city in the world fighting against SARS-CoV-2, may provide useful guidance for other countries in dealing with similar situations.

We implement a machine learning approach to select instrumental variables that strongly predict virus transmission among the rich exogenous weather characteristics. Our 2SLS estimates show that the stringent quarantine, massive lockdown and other public health measures imposed in late January significantly reduced the transmission rate of COVID-19. By early February, the virus spread had been contained. While many socioeconomic factors mediate the virus spread, a robust government response since late January played a determinant role in the containment of the virus. We also demonstrate that the actual population flow from the outbreak source poses a higher risk to the destination than other factors such as geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. The results have rich implications for ongoing global efforts in containment of COVID-19.

We evaluated the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for 2019-nCoV infection. In our baseline scenario, we estimated that 46.5% (95%CI: 35.9 to 57.7) of infected travellers would not be detected, depending on the incubation period, sensitivity of exit and entry screening, and the proportion of cases which are asymptomatic. Airport screening is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers to avoid entry of infected travellers. We developed an online tool so that results can be updated as new information becomes available.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementSF and SC are supported by a Sir Henry Dale Fellowship jointly funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Royal Society (Grant number 208812/Z/17/Z).

To describe and predict the dynamics of the disease, several preliminary mathematical models are formulated by various international study groups.

We present an estimate of the point prevalence of COVID-19 compared to the number of confirmed case in Italy based on the daily death rate and information about the incubation period, time from symptom onset to death and reported case fatality rate. Our model predicts that when the first 3 infected cases had been identified by Italian authorities there were already nearly 30 cases in Italy, and by the 24th of February 2020 only 0.5% cases had been detected and confirmed by Italian authorities. While official statistics had 132 confirmed case we believe a more accurate estimate would be closer to 26000. With a case-doubling period of about 2.5 days.

The first patients began experiencing symptoms of illness in mid-December 2019. Clinical isolates were found to contain a novel coronavirus with similarity to bat coronaviruses. As of 28 January 2020, there are in excess of 4,500 laboratory-confirmed cases, with &gt; 100 known deaths. As with the SARS-CoV, infections in children appear to be rare. Travel-related cases have been confirmed in multiple countries and regions outside mainland China including Germany, France, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Canada, and the United States, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. Domestically in China, the virus has also been noted in several cities and provinces with cases in all but one provinence. While zoonotic transmission appears to be the original source of infections, the most alarming development is that human-to-human transmission is now prevelant. Of particular concern is that many healthcare workers have been infected in the current epidemic. There are several critical clinical questions that need to be resolved, including how efficient is human-to-human transmission? What is the animal reservoir? Is there an intermediate animal reservoir? Do the vaccines generated to the SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV or their proteins offer protection against 2019-nCoV? We offer a research perspective on the next steps for the generation of vaccines. We also present data on the use of in silico docking in gaining insight into 2019-nCoV Spike-receptor binding to aid in therapeutic development.

This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of 2019-nCoV genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This nCoV genotype might have been evolved from a bat-CoV by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on 2019-nCoV during evolution. Interestingly, 2019-nCoV Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide (5’-aAT GGT GTT GAA GGT TTT AAT TGT TAC TTT CCT TTA CAA Tca-3’) sequence insertion, which shares homology to fish genomic sequence of Myripristis murdjan, an abundant fish type in Indo-Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit CoV vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. Our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of CoV strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic CoV strains.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Randhawa, Gurjit S</author><author>Soltysiak, Maximillian P M</author><author>El Roz, Hadi</author><author>de Souza, Camila P E</author><author>Hill, Kathleen A</author><author>Kari, Lila</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Machine learning-based analysis of genomes suggests associations between Wuhan 2019-nCoV and bat Betacoronaviruses</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.03.932350</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.03.932350</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Randhawa et al. - 2020 - Machine learning-based analysis of genomes suggests associations between Wuhan 2019-nCoV and bat Betacoronaviru.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/02/04/2020.02.03.932350.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>As of February 3, 2020, the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread to 27 countries with 362 deaths and more than 17000 confirmed cases. 2019-nCoV is being compared to the infamous SARS coronavirus outbreak. Between November 2002 and July 2003, SARS resulted in 8098 confirmed cases worldwide with a 9.6% death rate and 774 deaths. Mainland China alone suffered 349 deaths and 5327 confirmed cases. Though 2019-nCoV has a death rate of 2.2% as of 3 February, the 174895 confirmed cases in a few weeks (December 8, 2019 to February 3, 2020) are alarming. Cases are likely under-reported given the comparatively longer incubation period. Such outbreaks demand rapid elucidation and analysis of the virus genomic sequence for timely treatment plans. We classify the 2019-nCoV using MLDSP and MLDSP-GUI, alignment-free methods that use Machine Learning (ML) and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for genome analyses. Genomic sequences were mapped into their respective genomic signals (discrete numeric series) using a two-dimensional numerical representation (Chaos Game Representation). The magnitude spectra were computed by applying Discrete Fourier Transform on the genomic signals. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient was used to calculate a pairwise distance matrix. The feature vectors were constructed from the distance matrix and used as an input to the supervised machine learning algorithms. 10-fold cross-validation was applied to compute the average classification accuracy scores. The trained classifier models were used to predict the labels of 29 2019-nCoV sequences. The classification strategy used over 5000 genomes and tested associations at taxonomic levels of realm to species. From our machine learning-based alignment-free analyses using MLDSP-GUI, we corroborate the current hypothesis of a bat origin and classify 2019-nCoV as Sarbecovirus, within Betacoronavirus.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rao, Arni S.R.

A better understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is urgently needed. Clinically, it is important to identify who may be susceptible to infection and identify treatments for the disease. There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for 2019-nCoV, and studies also suggested that high expression of ACE2 may increase susceptibility to infection. Here we conducted a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) study to prioritize diseases/traits and blood proteins that may be causally linked to ACE2 expression in the lung. Expression data was based on GTEx. We also explored drug candidates whose targets overlapped with the top-ranked proteins in MR analysis, as these drugs could potentially alter ACE2 expression and may be clinically relevant. Notably, MR is much less vulnerable to confounding and reverse causality compared to observational studies. The most consistent finding was a tentative causal association between diabetes-related traits and increased ACE2 expression. Based on one of the largest GWAS on type II diabetes (T2DM) to date (N=898,130), we found that T2DM is causally linked to raised ACE2 expression (beta=0.1835, 95% CI 0.0853-0.2817; p=2.49E-4; GSMR method). Significant associations (at nominal level; p&lt;0.05) was also observed across multiple datasets, with different analytic methods, and for both type I and II diabetes. Other diseases/traits having nominal significant associations with increased ACE2 included inflammatory bowel disease, (ER+) breast and lung cancers, asthma, smoking and elevated ALT, among others. We also uncovered a number of plasma/serum proteins potentially linked to altered ACE2 expression, and the top enriched pathways included cytokine-cytokine-receptor interaction, VEGF signaling, JAK-STAT signaling etc. We also explored drugs that target some of the top-ranked proteins in the MR analysis. In conclusion, the current MR analysis reveals diseases/traits and blood proteins that may causally affect ACE2 expression, which in turn may influence susceptibility to the infection. The proteome-wide MR analysis may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ACE2 expression, and may help guide drug repositioning in the future. Nevertheless, we stress that further studies are required to verify our findings due to various limitations and the exploratory nature of some analyses.

The number of identified cases in Wuhan has increased rapidly since, and cases have been identified in other Chinese cities and other countries (as of 23 January 2020). We fitted a transmission model to reported case information up to 21 January to estimate key epidemiological measures, and to predict the possible course of the epidemic, as the potential impact of travel restrictions into and from Wuhan. We estimate the basic reproduction number of the infection (R_0) to be 3.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.6-4.0), indicating that 72-75% of transmissions must be prevented by control measures for infections to stop increasing. We estimate that only 5.1% (95%CI, 4.8-5.5) of infections in Wuhan are identified, and by 21 January a total of 11,341 people (prediction interval, 9,217-14,245) had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. Should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan, we predict the epidemic in Wuhan will be substantially larger by 4 February (191,529 infections; prediction interval, 132,751-273,649), infection will be established in other Chinese cities, and importations to other countries will be more frequent. Our model suggests that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China; with a 99% effective reduction in travel, the size of the epidemic outside of Wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9% on 4 February. Our findings are critically dependent on the assumptions underpinning our model, and the timing and reporting of confirmed cases, and there is considerable uncertainty associated with the outbreak at this early stage. With these caveats in mind, our work suggests that a basic reproductive number for this 2019-nCoV outbreak is higher compared to other emergent coronaviruses, suggesting that containment or control of this pathogen may be substantially more difficult.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementJMR acknowledges support from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EP/N014499/1) and the Medical Research Council (MR/S004793/1).

Chinese authorities later identified a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the causative agent of the outbreak. As of January 23, 2020, 655 cases have been confirmed in China and several other countries. Understanding the transmission characteristics and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). We performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date. We found the basic reproduction number, R0, to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval 1.4—3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Transmission characteristics appear to be of a similar magnitude to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 1918 pandemic influenza. These findings underline the importance of heightened screening, surveillance and control efforts, particularly at airports and other travel hubs, in order to prevent further international spread of 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Riou, Julien</author><author>Hauser, Anthony</author><author>Counotte, Michel J</author><author>Althaus, Christian L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adjusted age-specific case fatality ratio during the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei, China, January and February 2020</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.04.20031104</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.04.20031104</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic that originated in Wuhan, China has spread to more than 60 countries.

Coronaviruses, like influenza viruses, circulate in nature in various animal species. Alpha-coronaviruses and beta-coronaviruses can infect mammals and gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses tend to infect birds, but some of them can also be transmitted to mammals. Although still preliminary, current data suggest that bats are the most probable initial source of the current 2019 novel CoV (2019nCoV) outbreak, that begun on December 2019 in Wuhan, China, apparently spreading from a &quot;wet market&quot; to multiple cities and provinces in China. This epidemic of 2019nCoV, already reaching more than 6,000 cases to-day (end of January 2020) (&gt;90% in China), will not be the last one linked to zoonotic spillover events.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J</author><author>Gallego, Viviana</author><author>Escalera-Antezana, Juan Pablo</author><author>Mendez, Claudio A</author><author>Zambrano, Lysien I</author><author>Franco-Paredes, Carlos</author><author>Suárez, Jose A</author><author>Rodriguez-Enciso, Hernan D</author><author>Balbin-Ramon, Graciela Josefina</author><author>Savio-Larriera, Eduardo</author><author>Risquez, Alejandro</author><author>Cimerman, Sergio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>COVID-19 in Latin America: The implications of the first confirmed case in Brazil.</title><secondary-title>Travel medicine and infectious disease</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Travel medicine and infectious disease</full-title></periodical><pages>101613</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Travel Med Infect Dis</publisher><accession-num>32126292</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101613</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32126292</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;peer;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J.</author><author>Cardona-Ospina, Jaime A.</author><author>Gutiérrez-Ocampo, Estefanía</author><author>Villamizar-Peña, Rhuvi</author><author>Holguin-Rivera, Yeimer</author><author>Escalera-Antezana, Juan Pablo</author><author>Alvarado-Arnez, Lucia Elena</author><author>Bonilla-Aldana, D.

While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We provide timely short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative case data for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7,409-7,496 additional cases in Hubei and 1,128-1,929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days. Models also predict an average total cumulative case count between 37,415 - 38,028 in Hubei and 11,588 - 13,499 in other provinces by February 24, 2020. Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th - 9th). Our forecasts suggest that the containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission and that the epidemic growth has slowed in recent days.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roosa, Kimberlyn</author><author>Lee, Yiseul</author><author>Luo, Ruiyan</author><author>Kirpich, Alexander</author><author>Rothenberg, Richard</author><author>Hyman, James M.</author><author>Yan, Ping</author><author>Chowell, Gerardo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Short-term Forecasts of the COVID-19 Epidemic in Guangdong and Zhejiang, China: February 13–23, 2020</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>596</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>19</keyword><keyword>COVID</keyword><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>epidemic model</keyword><keyword>phenomenological models</keyword><keyword>real</keyword><keyword>sub</keyword><keyword>time forecasts</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/jcm9020596</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/2/596</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic continues to spread within and outside of China, despite several social distancing measures implemented by the Chinese government. Limited epidemiological data are available, and recent changes in case definition and reporting further complicate our understanding of the impact of the epidemic, particularly in the epidemic’s epicenter. Here we use previously validated phenomenological models to generate short-term forecasts of cumulative reported cases in Guangdong and Zhejiang, China. Using daily reported cumulative case data up until 13 February 2020 from the National Health Commission of China, we report 5- and 10-day ahead forecasts of cumulative case reports. Specifically, we generate forecasts using a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model, which have each been previously used to forecast outbreaks due to different infectious diseases. Forecasts from each of the models suggest the outbreaks may be nearing extinction in both Guangdong and Zhejiang; however, the sub-epidemic model predictions also include the potential for further sustained transmission, particularly in Zhejiang. Our 10-day forecasts across the three models predict an additional 65–81 cases (upper bounds: 169–507) in Guangdong and an additional 44–354 (upper bounds: 141–875) cases in Zhejiang by February 23, 2020. In the best-case scenario, current data suggest that transmission in both provinces is slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rothan, Hussin A.</author><author>Byrareddy, Siddappa N.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The epidemiology and pathogenesis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak</title><secondary-title>Journal of Autoimmunity</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Autoimmunity</full-title></periodical><pages>102433</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>J Autoimmun</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jaut.2020.102433</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0896841120300469</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Russell, Clark D</author><author>Millar, Jonathan E</author><author>Baillie, J Kenneth</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical evidence does not support corticosteroid treatment for 2019-nCoV lung injury</title><secondary-title>The Lancet</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30317-2</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736</url><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673620303172</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak is a major challenge for clinicians. The clinical course of patients remains to be fully characterised, little data are available that describe the disease pathogenesis, and no pharmacological therapies of proven efficacy yet exist. Corticosteroids were widely used during the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV 1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, 2 and are being used in patients with 2019-nCoV in addition to other therapeutics. 3 However, current interim guidance from WHO on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection is suspected (released Jan 28, 2020) advises against the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason. 4 Understanding the evidence for harm or benefit from corticosteroids in 2019-nCoV is of immediate clinical importance. Here we discuss the clinical outcomes of corticosteroid use in coronavirus and similar outbreaks (table). Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome are partly caused by host immune responses. Corticosteroids suppress lung inflammation but also inhibit immune responses and pathogen clearance. In SARS-CoV infection, as with influenza, systemic inflammation is associated with adverse outcomes. 12 In SARS, inflammation persists after viral clearance. 13,14 Pulmonary histology in both SARS and MERS infections reveals inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage, 15 with one report suggesting haemophagocytosis. 16 Theoretically, corticosteroid treatment could have a role to suppress lung inflammation. In a retrospective observational study reporting on 309 adults who were critically ill with MERS, 2 almost half of patients (151 [49%]) were given corticosteroids (median hydrocortisone equivalent dose [ie, methylprednisolone 1:5, dexamethasone 1:25, prednisolone 1:4] of 300 mg/day). Patients who were given corticosteroids were more likely to require mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. After statistical adjustment for immortal time and indication biases, the authors concluded that administration of corticosteroids was not associated with a difference in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 0·8, 95% CI 0·5-1·1; p=0·12) but was associated with delayed clearance of viral RNA from respiratory tract secretions (adjusted hazard ratio 0·4, 95% CI 0·2-0·7; p=0·0005). However, these effect estimates have a high risk of error due to the probable presence of unmeasured confounders. In a meta-analysis of corticosteroid use in patients with SARS, only four studies provided conclusive data, all indicating harm. 1 The first was a case-control study of SARS patients with (n=15) and without (n=30) SARS-related psychosis; all were given corticosteroid treatment, but those who developed psychosis were given a higher cumulative dose than those who did not (10 975 mg hydrocortisone equivalent vs 6780 mg; p=0·017). 6 The second was a randomised controlled trial of 16 patients with SARS who were not critically ill; the nine patients who were given hydrocortisone (mean 4·8 days [95% CI 4·1-5·5] since fever onset) had greater viraemia in the second and third weeks after infection than those who were given 0·9% saline control. 5 The Outcomes of corticosteroid therapy* Comment MERS-CoV Delayed clearance of viral RNA from respiratory tract 2 Adjusted hazard ratio 0·4 (95% CI 0·2-0·7) SARS-CoV Delayed clearance of viral RNA from blood 5 Significant difference but effect size not quantified SARS-CoV Complication: psychosis 6 Associated with higher cumulative dose, 10 975 mg vs 6780 mg hydrocortisone equivalent SARS-CoV Complication: diabetes 7 33 (35%) of 95 patients treated with corticosteroid developed corticosteroid-induced diabetes SARS-CoV Complication: avascular necrosis in survivors 8 Among 40 patients who survived after corticosteroid treatment, 12 (30%) had avascular necrosis and 30 (75%) had osteoporosis Influenza Increased mortality 9 Risk ratio for mortality 1·75 (95% CI 1·3-2·4) in a meta-analysis of 6548 patients from ten studies RSV No clinical benefit in children 10,11 No effect in largest randomised controlled trial of 600 children, of whom 305 (51%) had been treated with corticosteroids CoV=coronavirus.

After China, Italy is currently at the forefront of the combat against the epidemic that has now spread to all 22 Italian regions. The disease is sweeping through Lombardy, which remains in lockdown since the 8th of March. As of the same day, the isolation measures taken in Lombardy have been extended to the entire country. On March 11, the WHO declared COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we provide estimates for: (a) the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy; (b) the actual number of exposed/infected cases in the total population; (c) the basic reproduction number (R0); (d) the effective per-day disease transmission and mortality rates; and, importantly, (e) a forecast for the fade out of the outbreak, on the basis of the released data of confirmed cases for Lombardy from February 21 to March 8, the day of lockdown. Methods To deal with the uncertainty in the number of actual exposed/ infected cases in the total population, we address a new compartmental Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infectious/ Recovered/ Dead (SEIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the total cases in the population and another modelling the confirmed cases. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the DAY-ZERO of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the effective per-day transmission and mortality rates for which no clinical data are available, we have used the SEIRD simulator to fit the data from February 21 to the 8th of March, the lockdown day of Lombardy (and of all Italy). This was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem with the aid of genetic algorithms. Based on the computed values, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number R0. Furthermore, by reducing the estimated transmission rate by 90% on March 8 (to reflect the lockdown of almost all activities), we run the simulator from March 8 to forecast the fade out of the outbreak. Findings Based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the actual cumulative number of exposed cases in the total population in Lombardy on March 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases. According to this scenario, the DAY-ZERO for the outbreak in Lombardy was the 21st of January 2020. The effective per-day disease transmission rate for the period until March 8 was found to be 0.779 (90% CI: 0.777-0.781), while the &quot;effective&quot; per-day mortality rate was found to be 0.0173 (90% CI: 0.0154-0.0192). Based on these values, the basic reproduction rate R0 was found to be 4.04 (90% CI: 4.03-4.05). Importantly, by reducing the transmission rate by 90% on March 8 to reflect the suspension of almost all activities in Italy, we run the simulator to forecast the fade out of the epidemic. Simulations show that if the measures continue, the complete fade out of the outbreak in Lombardy is expected to occur by the end of May 2020.

Due to international travel and human-to-human transmission, the virus spread rapidly inside and outside of China. Currently, there is no effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19, therefore research efforts are focused on the rapid development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease constitutes one of the most attractive antiviral drug targets. To address this emerging problem, we have synthesized a combinatorial library of fluorogenic substrates with glutamine in the P1 position. We used it to determine the substrate preferences of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteases, using natural and a large panel of unnatural amino acids. The results of our work provide a structural framework for the design of inhibitors as antiviral agents or diagnostic tests.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rut, Wioletta</author><author>Żmudziński, Mikołaj</author><author>Snipas, Scott J</author><author>Bekes, Miklos</author><author>Huang, Tony T</author><author>Drag, Marcin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Engineered unnatural ubiquitin for optimal detection of deubiquitinating enzymes</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.30.926881</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.30.926881</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/31/2020.01.30.926881.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are responsible for removing ubiquitin (Ub) from its protein conjugates. DUBs have been implicated as attractive therapeutic targets in the treatment of viral diseases, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. The lack of selective chemical tools for the exploration of these enzymes significantly impairs the determination of their roles in both normal and pathological states. Commercially available fluorogenic substrates are based on the C-terminal Ub motif or contain Ub coupled to a fluorophore (Z-LRGG-AMC, Ub-AMC); therefore, these substrates suffer from lack of selectivity. By using a hybrid combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) and a defined P2 library containing a wide variety of nonproteinogenic amino acids, we established a full substrate specificity profile for two DUBs—MERS PLpro and human UCH-L3. Based on these results, we designed and synthesized Ub-based substrates and activity-based probes (ABPs) containing selected unnatural amino acids located in the C-terminal Ub motif. Biochemical analysis and cell-based experiments confirmed the activity and selectivity of engineered Ub-based substrates and probes. Using this approach, we propose that for any protease that recognizes Ub and Ub-like substrates, a highly active and selective unnatural substrate or probe can be engineered.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ryu, Sukhyun</author><author>Ali, Sheikh Taslim</author><author>Lim, Jun-sik</author><author>Chun, Byung Chul</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The estimate of infected individuals of the 2019-Novel Coronavirus in South Korea by incoming international students from the countries of risk of 2019-Novel Coronavirus: a simulation study</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.15.20023234</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.15.20023234</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Ryu et al. - 2020 - The estimate of infected individuals of the 2019-Novel Coronavirus in South Korea by incoming international students.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Overall, 37000 international students from the country of risk of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) will arrive in South Korea. The individuals from the country of risk of COVID-19 are included a home-quarantine program, but the efficacy of the program is uncertain. To estimate the possible number of infected individuals due to the large influx of international students, the deterministic compartment was modeled by different compliance of home-quarantine. Our findings, under the strict compliance of quarantine for the incoming international students, indicate it is less likely to occur epidemics in South Korea. To mitigate possible epidemics, considerable public health resources with high compliance of quarantine are needed. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement Not applicable ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Recent work indicates variation among countries in detection capacity for imported cases. Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection. We therefore used a Bayesian modeling approach to estimate the relative imported case detection efficiency for other countries compared to that of Singapore. We estimate that the global ability to detect imported cases is 38% (95% HPDI 22% - 64%) of Singapore′s capacity. Equivalently, an estimate of 2.8 (95% HPDI 1.5 - 4.4) times the current number of imported cases, could have been detected, given all countries had the same detection capacity as Singapore. Using the second component of the Global Health Security index to stratify country likely detection capacities, we found that the ability to detect imported cases among high surveillance countries is 40% (95% HPDI 22% - 67%), among intermediate surveillance countries it is 37% (95% HPDI 18% - 68%), and among low surveillance countries it is 11% (95% HPDI 0% - 42%). We conclude that estimates of case counts in Wuhan based on assumptions of perfect detection in travelers may be underestimated by several fold, and severity correspondingly overestimated by several fold. Undetected cases are likely in countries around the world, with greater risk in countries of low detection capacity and high connectivity to the epicenter of the outbreak.

Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.

To date, there is no antiviral therapy or vaccine is available which can effectively combat the infection caused by this virus. This study was conducted to design possible epitope-based subunit vaccines against the 2019-nCoV using the approaches of reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatics. Upon continual computational experimentation three possible vaccine constructs were designed and one vaccine construct was selected as the best vaccine based on molecular docking study which is supposed to effectively act against the Wuhan Novel Coronavirus. Later, molecular dynamics simulation and in silico codon adaptation experiments were carried out in order to check biological stability and find effective mass production strategy of the selected vaccine. Hopefully, this study will contribute to uphold the present efforts of the researches to secure a definitive treatment against this nasty virus.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schwartz</author><author>Graham</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potential Maternal and Infant Outcomes from (Wuhan) Coronavirus 2019-nCoV Infecting Pregnant Women: Lessons from SARS, MERS, and Other Human Coronavirus Infections</title><secondary-title>Viruses</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Viruses</full-title></periodical><pages>194</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>2019</keyword><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>CoV</keyword><keyword>MERS</keyword><keyword>Middle East respiratory syndrome</keyword><keyword>SARS</keyword><keyword>Wuhan coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Wuhan coronavirus outbreak</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>emerging infection</keyword><keyword>epidemic</keyword><keyword>maternal death</keyword><keyword>maternal morbidity</keyword><keyword>maternal mortality</keyword><keyword>nCoV</keyword><keyword>pneumonia</keyword><keyword>pregnancy</keyword><keyword>pregnancy complications</keyword><keyword>severe acute respiratory syndrome</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/v12020194</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/2/194</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>&lt;p&gt;In early December 2019 a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause was identified in Wuhan, a city of 11 million persons in the People’s Republic of China. Further investigation revealed these cases to result from infection with a newly identified coronavirus, termed the 2019-nCoV. The infection moved rapidly through China, spread to Thailand and Japan, extended into adjacent countries through infected persons travelling by air, eventually reaching multiple countries and continents. Similar to such other coronaviruses as those causing the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the new coronavirus was reported to spread via natural aerosols from human-to-human. In the early stages of this epidemic the case fatality rate is estimated to be approximately 2%, with the majority of deaths occurring in special populations. Unfortunately, there is limited experience with coronavirus infections during pregnancy, and it now appears certain that pregnant women have become infected during the present 2019-nCoV epidemic. In order to assess the potential of the Wuhan 2019-nCoV to cause maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity and other poor obstetrical outcomes, this communication reviews the published data addressing the epidemiological and clinical effects of SARS, MERS, and other coronavirus infections on pregnant women and their infants. Recommendations are also made for the consideration of pregnant women in the design, clinical trials, and implementation of future 2019-nCoV vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shaman, Jeffrey</author><author>Galanti, Marta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Direct Measurement of Rates of Asymptomatic Infection and Clinical Care-Seeking for Seasonal Coronavirus</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.30.20019612</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.30.20019612</url><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/03/2020.01.30.20019612.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>The pandemic potential of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) that emerged in Wuhan, China, during December 2019 is strongly tied to the number and contagiousness of undocumented human infections.

We find that the majority of infections are asymptomatic by most symptom definitions and that only 4% of individuals experiencing a seasonal coronavirus infection episode sought medical care for their symptoms. These numbers indicate that a very high percentage of seasonal coronavirus infections are undocumented and provide a reference for understanding the spread of the emergent nCoV.

This virus is responsible for the ongoing outbreak that causes severe respiratory illness and pneumonia-like infection in humans. Due to the increasing number of cases in China and outside China, the WHO declared coronavirus as a global health emergency. Nearly 35,000 cases were reported and at least 24 other countries or territories have reported coronavirus cases as early on as February. Inter-human transmission was reported in a few countries, including the United States. Neither an effective anti-viral nor a vaccine is currently available to treat this infection. As the virus is a newly emerging pathogen, many questions remain unanswered regarding the virus’s reservoirs, pathogenesis, transmissibility, and much more is unknown. The collaborative efforts of researchers are needed to fill the knowledge gaps about this new virus, to develop the proper diagnostic tools, and effective treatment to combat this infection. Recent advancements in plant biotechnology proved that plants have the ability to produce vaccines or biopharmaceuticals rapidly in a short time. In this review, the outbreak of 2019-nCoV in China, the need for rapid vaccine development, and the potential of a plant system for biopharmaceutical development are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shao, Nian</author><author>Cheng, Jin</author><author>Chen, Wenbin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The reproductive number R0 of COVID-19 Based on estimate of a statistical time delay dynamical system</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.17.20023747</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.17.20023747</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>In this paper, we estimate the reproductive number $R\_0$ of COVID-19 based on Walling and Lipsitch framework \cite{WL} and a novel statistical time delay dynamic system.We use the observed data reported in CCDC's paper to estimate distribution of the generation interval of the infection and apply the simulation results from the time delay dynamic system as well as released data from CCDC to fit the growth rate.

Based on the cumulative number of confirmed cases and cured cases published daily by government, we effectively simulate and predict the outbreak trend of COVID-19 in different regions in China. Meanwhile, the model reveals the growth rate of the epidemic, through which the basic reproductive number is thus estimated to be 3.25 to 3.4. Then, we apply the model to track the spread of COVID-19 in Japan. We find that the trend of the epidemic in Japan is strikingly similar to that in Wuhan, China at the early stage. Therefore there are reasons to draw a serious concern that there could be a rapid outbreak in Japan if no effective control measures are carried out immediately. Finally, we make a prediction of the future trend of COVID-19 in Japan, and suggest an enhancement of control measures as soon as possible, so as to avoid a severe outbreak

The dissemination of COVID-19 was simulated using computational experiments to identify the mechanisms underlying the impact of city and residential lockdowns on controlling the spread of the epidemic. Results: The implementation of measures to lock down cities led to higher mortality rates in these cities, due to reduced mobility. Moreover, implementing city lockdown along with addition of hospital beds led to improved cure and reduced mortality rates. Stringent implementation and early lockdown of residential units effectively controlled the spread of the epidemic, and reduced the number of hospital bed requirements. Collectively, measures to lock down cities and residential units should be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In addition, medical resources should be increased in cities under lockdown. Implementation of these measures would reduce the spread of the virus to other cities and allow appropriate treatment of patients in cities under lockdown.

It is still unclear how fast the virus evolved and how the virus interacts with other microorganisms in the lung. METHODS: We have conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of eight SARS-CoV-2 patients, 25 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients, and 20 healthy controls. RESULTS: The median number of intra-host variants was 1-4 in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, which ranged between 0 and 51 in different samples. The distribution of variants on genes was similar to those observed in the population data (110 sequences). However, very few intra-host variants were observed in the population as polymorphism, implying either a bottleneck or purifying selection involved in the transmission of the virus, or a consequence of the limited diversity represented in the current polymorphism data. Although current evidence did not support the transmission of intra-host variants in a person-to-person spread, the risk should not be overlooked. The microbiota in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was similar to those in CAP, either dominated by the pathogens or with elevated levels of oral and upper respiratory commensal bacteria. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 evolves in vivo after infection, which may affect its virulence, infectivity, and transmissibility. Although how the intra-host variant spreads in the population is still elusive, it is necessary to strengthen the surveillance of the viral evolution in the population and associated clinical changes.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shi, Heshui</author><author>Han, Xiaoyu</author><author>Jiang, Nanchuan</author><author>Cao, Yukun</author><author>Alwalid, Osamah</author><author>Gu, Jin</author><author>Fan, Yanqing</author><author>Zheng, Chuansheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Radiological findings from 81 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study.</title><secondary-title>The Lancet.

We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course. METHODS Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done ≤1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (&gt;1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (&gt;2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups. FINDINGS 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49·5 years (SD 11·0). The mean number of involved lung segments was 10·5 (SD 6·4) overall, 2·8 (3·3) in group 1, 11·1 (5·4) in group 2, 13·0 (5·7) in group 3, and 12·1 (5·9) in group 4. The predominant pattern of abnormality observed was bilateral (64 [79%] patients), peripheral (44 [54%]), ill-defined (66 [81%]), and ground-glass opacification (53 [65%]), mainly involving the right lower lobes (225 [27%] of 849 affected segments). In group 1 (n=15), the predominant pattern was unilateral (nine [60%]) and multifocal (eight [53%]) ground-glass opacities (14 [93%]). Lesions quickly evolved to bilateral (19 [90%]), diffuse (11 [52%]) ground-glass opacity predominance (17 [81%]) in group 2 (n=21). Thereafter, the prevalence of ground-glass opacities continued to decrease (17 [57%] of 30 patients in group 3, and five [33%] of 15 in group 4), and consolidation and mixed patterns became more frequent (12 [40%] in group 3, eight [53%] in group 4). INTERPRETATION COVID-19 pneumonia manifests with chest CT imaging abnormalities, even in asymptomatic patients, with rapid evolution from focal unilateral to diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities that progressed to or co-existed with consolidations within 1-3 weeks. Combining assessment of imaging features with clinical and laboratory findings could facilitate early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

DESIGN Ecological study. SETTING 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Data on COVID-19 incidence and climate between Jan 20 and Feb 29, 2020. RESULTS The number of new confirm COVID-19 cases in mainland China peaked on Feb 1, 2020. COVID-19 daily incidence were lowest at -10 ℃ and highest at 10 ℃,while the maximum incidence was observed at the absolute humidity of approximately 7 g/m3. COVID-19 incidence changed with temperature as daily incidence decreased when the temperature rose. No significant association between COVID-19 incidence and absolute humidity was observed in distributed lag nonlinear models. Additionally, A modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model confirmed that transmission rate decreased with the increase of temperature, leading to further decrease of infection rate and outbreak scale. CONCLUSION Temperature is an environmental driver of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Lower and higher temperatures might be positive to decrease the COVID-19 incidence. M-SEIR models help to better evaluate environmental and social impacts on COVID-19.

Here, the infectious ability of patients during the latent period is slightly less than that of the infected patients was assumed. We established a new SEIR propagation dynamics model, that considered the weak transmission ability of the incubation period, the variation of the incubation period length, and the government intervention measures to track and isolate comprehensively. Based on the raw epidemic data of China from January 23, 2020 to February 10, 2020, the dynamic parameters of the new present SEIR model are fitted. Through the Euler integration algorithm to solve the model, the effect of infectious ability of incubation patients on the theoretical estimation of the present SEIR model was analyzed, and the occurrence time of peak number in China was predicted.

Few studies focused on clinical characteristics non-survivors hospitalized with COVID-19. Objectives: We aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of died patients with COVID-19 and tracked the causes of the rapid disease progression and death. Methods: 101 non-surviving patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study. Clinical data were collected and compared between non-survivors who died within 3 days and after 3 days of admission. Multivariable regression analysis was used to analyze risk factors associated with rapid disease progression and death. Measurements and Main Results: Among included patients, median age was 71 years (IQR, 59-80), 60 (59.41%) were men. 82 (81.19%) had one or more comorbidities including hypertension (59 [58.42%]), diabetes (22 [21.78%]) etc. 100 (99.01%) suffered respiratory failure, 53 (52.48%) developed acute cardiac injury, acute kidney and liver injury occurred in 23 (22.77%) and 18 (17.82%) patients, respectively. Multivariable regression analysis showed that elevated high sensitivity troponin I (OR 2.68, 95%CI 1.31-5.49, P=0.007), neutrophils (OR 1.14, 95%CI 1.01-1.28, P=0.033) and depressed oxygen saturation (OR 0.94, 95%CI 0.89-0.99, P=0.027) on admission were associated with rapid death of patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: Older patients (&gt;70 years) with comorbidities had a steeply increased risk of death with COVID-19. Respiratory failure, acute cardiac and kidney injury played a crucial role in the death of patients. Elevated high sensitivity troponin, neutrophils and depressed oxygen saturation predicted the rapid death of patients.

DESIGN Retrospective case series. SETTING Two campus of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, and is responsible for the treatments for COVID-19 assigned by the government PARTICIPANTS 101 non-surviving hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19. Data were collected from 1 January 2020 to 15 February 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Clinical data were collected using a standardized case report form. If information was not clear, the investigators in Wuhan contacted the doctor responsible for treating the patients or family members of non-survivors for clarification. RESULTS Of 121 died patients with confirmed COVID-19, 101 cases with relatively complete medical records were included. The median age of the 101 non-survivors were 71 years (IQR, 59-80), 60 (59.41%) were men. 82 (81.19%) had fever, 82 (81.19%) had 1 or more comorbidities including hypertension (59 [58.42%]) and diabetes (22 [21.78%]) etc. The median course from hospitalization to death was 4d (IQR, 2-7d). Of 101 died patients, 100 (99.01%) suffered respiratory failure, 53 (52.48%) developed acute myocardial injury, acute kidney and liver injury occurred in 23 (22.77%) and 18 (17.82%) patients, respectively. Chest computed tomographic scans of non-survivors showed vast and fused ground-glass shadows. Compared to patients who survived 3 days, no statistical difference was noticed on lung severity score (11.91 vs 12.07) in patients who died within 3 days. Furthermore, significant elevated laboratory indicators including hypersensitive troponin (1.98 vs 0.2ng/ml), blood urea nitrogen (15.20 vs 10.08mmol/l), neutrophil count (11.23 vs 6.48 *109/L), procalcitonin (2.26 vs 0.58ng/ml) and lactic acid (3.80 vs 2.62 mmol/l) etc. were noted in patients who died with 3 days while PaO2 (54.75 vs 67.45mmHg), CD3% (51.57 vs 60.43%) and CD8% (16.42 vs 23.42%) were significantly depressed. CONCLUSION Older patients (&gt;70 years) with comorbidities had a steeply increased risk of death when they suffered COVID-19. Besides respiratory failure, acute cardiac and kidney damage or failure, secondary to COVID-19, played a crucial role in causing death of patients.

The immunopathological characteristics of COVID-19 patients, either systemic or local, have not been thoroughly studied. In the present study, we analyzed both the changes in the cellularity of various immune cell types as well as cytokines important for immune reactions and inflammation. Our data indicate that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited an overall decline of lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells. The number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells was moderately increased in patients with mild COVID-19. IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 were remarkably up-regulated in patients with severe COVID-19. The levels of IL-2 and IL-6 relative to the length of hospital stay underwent a similar &quot;rise-decline&quot; pattern, probably reflecting the therapeutic effect. In conclusion, our study shows that the comprehensive decrease of lymphocytes, and the elevation of IL-2 and IL-6 are reliable indicators of severe COVID-19.

Methods: We collected incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases from National and Provincial Health Committee reports from January 10 to February 29, 2020. Volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan to other provinces was measured by Baidu Migration Index, a widely used metric that tracks migration based on cellphone location. We used cross-correlation function and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to examine time-lagged association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence by province. Contributors to the provincial variation in the temporal associations were investigated. Additionally, we estimated the reduction in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases following the travel ban for Wuhan. Results: Cross-correlation function analyses suggested that the volume of outbound traffic from Wuhan was positively associated with COVID-19 incidence in all provinces, with correlation coefficients between 0.22-0.78 (all P&lt;0.05). Approximately 42% of provinces showed &lt;1 week of lag between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence, 39% with 1 week, and 19% with 2-3 weeks. Migration had more prolonged impacts in provinces closer to Wuhan and with more passenger influx from Wuhan, but affected economically advantaged provinces to a lesser extent. We further estimated that the travel ban may have prevented approximately 19,768 COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 13,589, 25,946) outside of Wuhan by February 29, 2020. Conclusions: Outflowing migration from Wuhan facilitated the COVID-19 transmission to other parts of China with varying time-lagged effects dependent on provincial characteristics. The travel ban led to a significant reduction in COVID-19 outside of Wuhan.

To examine the growth rate of the outbreak, we aimed to present the first study to report the reproduction number of COVID-19 in South Korea. METHODS The daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea were extracted from publicly available sources. By using the empirical reporting delay distribution and simulating the generalized growth model, we estimated the effective reproduction number based on the discretized probability distribution of the generation interval. RESULTS We identified four major clusters and estimated the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6). In addition, the intrinsic growth rate was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI: 0.6, 0.7) and the scaling of growth parameter was estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8), indicating sub-exponential growth dynamics of COVID-19. The crude case fatality rate is higher among males (1.1%) compared to females (0.4%) and increases with older age. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate early sustained transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shim, Eunha</author><author>Tariq, Amna</author><author>Choi, Wongyeong</author><author>Lee, Yiseul</author><author>Chowell, Gerardo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transmission potential of COVID-19 in South Korea</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.27.20028829</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.27.20028829</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Shim et al. - 2020 - Transmission potential of COVID-19 in South Korea.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Since the first identified individual of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection on Jan 20, 2020 in South Korea, the number of confirmed cases rapidly increased.

Up to March 3, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 89,000 people in China and other 66 countries across six continents. In this study, we used 10 new sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and combined 136 genomes from GISAID database to investigate the genetic variation and population demography through different analysis approaches (e.g. Network, EBSP, Mismatch, and neutrality tests) in the previous three months. The results showed that eighty haplotypes had 183 substitution sites, including 27 parsimony-informative and 156 singletons. Sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain range in mutations and variation in genomic abundance of SARS-CoV-2, which could be explaining the existing widespread and high adaptation of the deadly virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that pangolin may not be an intermediate host. The network indicated that, in the original haplotype (H14), one patient sample lived near the Huanan seafood market (approximately 2 km), which indicating high possibility of the patient having a history of unconscious contact with this market. However, based on this clue, we cannot accurately conclude that whether this market was the origin center of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, 16 genomes, collected from this market, assigned to 10 haplotypes, indicated a circulating infection within the market in a short term, which would have led to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and other areas. The EBSP results showed that the first estimated expansion date began from 7 December 2019, which indicated that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 could have begun from person to person in mid to late November.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Siegenfeld, Alexander F.</author><author>Bar-Yam, Yaneer</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Eliminating COVID-19: A Community-based Analysis</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10086</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>We analyze the spread of COVID-19 by considering the transmission of the disease among individuals both within and between communities. A set of communities can be defined as any partition of a population such that travel/social contact within each community far exceeds that between them (e.g. the U.S. could be partitioned by state or commuting zone boundaries). COVID-19 can be eliminated if the community-to-community reproductive number---i.e. the expected/average number of other communities to which a single infected community will transmit the virus---is reduced to less than one. We find that this community-to-community reproductive number is proportional to the travel rate between communities and exponential in the length of the time-delay before community-level action is taken. Thus, reductions in travel and the speed at which communities take action can play decisive roles in stopping the outbreak. The analysis suggests that for the coronavirus to be eliminated, it is not necessary to impose aggressive social distancing measures all over the world at once, but rather only in communities in which active spreading is detected. The sooner such measures are imposed, the shorter the duration they must remain in place. If infected communities (including those that become re-infected in the future) are quick enough to act, the number of actively infected communities (and thus the number of communities in which such measures are required) will exponentially decrease over time.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Silverstein, William Kyle</author><author>Stroud, Lynfa</author><author>Cleghorn, Graham Edward</author><author>Leis, Jerome Allen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>First imported case of 2019 novel coronavirus in Canada, presenting as mild pneumonia</title><secondary-title>The Lancet</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet</full-title></periodical><volume>0</volume><issue>0</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30370-6</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673620303706</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Siwiak, Marlena M</author><author>Szczesny, Pawel</author><author>Siwiak, Marian P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>From a single host to global spread.

We propose a set of parameters for the first COVID-19 Global Epidemic and Mobility Model (GLEaM). The simulation starting with just a single pre-symptomatic, yet infectious, case in Wuhan, China, results in an accurate prediction of the number of diagnosed cases after 125 days in multiple countries across three continents. Methods We have built a modified SIR model and parameterized it analytically, according to the literature and by fitting the missing parameters to the observed dynamics of the virus spread. We compared our results with the number of diagnosed cases in sixeight selected countries which provide reliable statistics but differ substantially in terms of strength and speed of undertaken precautions. The obtained 95% confidence intervals for the predictions fit well to the empirical data. Findings The parameters that successfully model the pandemic are: the basic reproduction number R0, ~4.4; a latent non-infectious period of 1.1. days followed by 4.6 days of the presymptomatic infectious period; the probability of developing severe symptoms, 0.01; the probability of being diagnosed when presenting severe symptoms of 0.6; the probability of diagnosis for cases with mild symptoms or asymptomatic, 0.001. Also, the higher the testing rate per country, the lower the discrepancy between data (diagnosed cases) and model. Interpretation Parameters that successfully reproduce the observed number of cases indicate that both R0 and the prevalence of the virus might be underestimated. This is in concordance with the newest research on undocumented COVID-19 cases. Consequently, the actual mortality rate is putatively lower than estimated. Confirmation of the pandemic characteristic by further refinement of the model and screening tests is crucial for developing an effective strategy for the global epidemiological crisis.

We assessed symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia in medical workers and the effect of social support in China during COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: We conducted this study using online questionnaires via a social networking software, Wechat, within a week from Feb 9th 2020 to Feb 15th 2020. Symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia were measured by Zung self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), Chinese version of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and Insomnia Severity Index, respetively. The assessment of social support was measured by the Social Support Rating Scale. Results: Among all the 5393 respondents, anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms of the population accounted for 5.9%, 28% and 34.3% of the total sample group, respectively. Female, contact with confirmed or suspected cases, work in the clinical first-line, low social support total score and low score in each dimension, nurses and other factors are closely related to the occurrence of depression, anxiety, insomnia symptoms.After controlling the Statistically significant population characteristics variables, we found that the total score of social support and the score of three dimensions were protective factors for psychological problems.

Effective screening for patients is important to limit the epidemic. However, some defects make the currently applied diagnosis methods are still not very ideal for early warning of patients. We aimed to develop a diagnostic model that allows for the quick screening of highly suspected patients using easy-to-get variables. METHODS A total of 1,311 patients receiving severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleicacid detection were included, whom with a positive result were classified into COVID-19 group. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to construct the diagnostic model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used for model validation. RESULTS After analysis, signs of pneumonia on CT, history of close contact, fever, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Tmax and sex were included in the diagnostic model. Age and meaningful respiratory symptoms were enrolled into COVID-19 early warning score (COVID-19 EWS). The areas under the ROC curve (AUROC) indicated that both of the diagnostic model (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.935-0.977, P &lt; 0.001]; validation dataset 0.960 [95%CI 0.919-1.0, P &lt; 0.001] ) and COVID-19 EWS (training dataset 0.956 [95%CI 0.934-0.978, P &lt; 0.001] ; validate dataset 0.966 [95%CI 0.929-1, P &lt; 0.001]) had good discrimination capacity. In addition, we also obtained the cut-off values of disease severity predictors, such as CT score, CD8+ T cell count, CD4+ T cell count, and so on. CONCLUSIONS The new developed COVID-19 EWS was a considerable tool for early and relatively accurately warning of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

Purpose To investigate the clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings of emerging coronavirus 2019-nCoV pneumonia in humans. Materials and Methods Fifty-one patients (25 men and 26 women, 16-76 years old) with 2019-nCoV pneumonia confirmed with the positive new coronavirus nucleic acid antibody underwent thin-section CT. The imaging findings, clinical and laboratory data were evaluated. Results Fifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of the endemic center Wuhan contact. Fever (49/51, 96%) and cough (24/51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37/51, 73%), neutrophil count (44/51, 86.3%) and normal (17/51, 35.3%) or reduced (33/51, 64.7%) lymphocyte count. CT images showed pure ground grass opacity (GGO) in 39/51 (77%) patients, GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38/51 (75%) patients. GGO with consolidation was present in 30/51 (59%) and pure consolidation in 28/51 (55%) patients. 44/51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41/51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44/51 (86%) were peripheral. There were more consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 or more days from disease onset to CT scan versus 4 or fewer days (431/712 lesions vs. 129/612 lesions, p &lt; 0.001). Patients more than 50 years old had more consolidated lung lesions than those 50 years or younger (212/470 vs. 198/854, p &lt; 0.001). Follow up CT in 13 patients showed improvement in 7 (54%) patients and progression in 4 (31%) patients. Conclusions Patients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous ground grass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posterior lungs on CT images combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic exposure are highly suspected of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Song, Peter X</author><author>Wang, Lili</author><author>Zhou, Yiwang</author><author>He, Jie</author><author>Zhu, Bin</author><author>Wang, Fei</author><author>Tang, Lu</author><author>Eisenberg, Marisa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An epidemiological forecast model and software assessing interventions on COVID-19 epidemic in China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.29.20029421</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.29.20029421</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>We develop a health informatics toolbox that enables public health workers to timely analyze and evaluate the time-course dynamics of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection using the public available data from the China CDC. This toolbox is built upon a hierarchical epidemiological model in which two observed time series of daily proportions of infected and removed cases are emitted from the underlying infection dynamics governed by a Markov SIR infectious disease process. We extend the SIR model to incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. We develop a calibration procedure for under-reported infected cases. This toolbox provides forecast, in both online and offline forms, of turning points of interest, including the time when daily infected proportion becomes smaller than the previous ones and the time when daily infected proportions becomes smaller than that of daily removed proportion, as well as the ending time of the epidemic. An R software is made available for the public, and examples on the use of this software are illustrated. Some possible extensions of our novel epidemiological models are discussed.

The outbreak was originally reported in Wuhan, China, but has subsequently been spread world-widely. As the COVID-19 continues to spread rapidly across the world, computed tomography (CT) has become essentially important for fast diagnoses. Thus, it is urgent to develop an accurate computer-aided method to assist clinicians to identify COVID-19-infected patients by CT images. Materials and Methods We collected chest CT scans of 88 patients diagnosed with the COVID-19 from hospitals of two provinces in China, 101 patients infected with bacteria pneumonia, and 86 healthy persons for comparison and modeling. Based on the collected dataset, a deep learning-based CT diagnosis system (DeepPneumonia) was developed to identify patients with COVID-19. Results The experimental results showed that our model can accurately identify the COVID-19 patients from others with an excellent AUC of 0.99 and recall (sensitivity) of 0.93. In addition, our model was capable of discriminating the COVID-19 infected patients and bacteria pneumonia-infected patients with an AUC of 0.95, recall (sensitivity) of 0.96. Moreover, our model could localize the main lesion features, especially the ground-glass opacity (GGO) that is of great help to assist doctors in diagnosis. The diagnosis for a patient could be finished in 30 seconds, and the implementation on Tianhe-2 supercompueter enables a parallel executions of thousands of tasks simultaneously. An online server is available for online diagnoses with CT images by http://biomed.nscc-gz.cn/server/Ncov2019. Conclusions The established models can achieve a rapid and accurate identification of COVID-19 in human samples, thereby allowing identification of patients.

Until a vaccine is developed, strategies for controlling the outbreak rely on aggressive social distancing. These measures largely disconnect the social network fabric of human societies, especially in urban areas. Here, we estimate the growth rates and reproductive numbers of COVID-19 in US cities from March 14th through March 19th to reveal a power-law scaling relationship to city population size. This means that COVID-19 is spreading faster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an uncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to become infected in more populous urban areas. We discuss the implications of these observations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, emphasizing the need to implement more aggressive distancing policies in larger cities while also with preserving socioeconomic activity.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Strzelecki, Artur</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Infodemiological Study Using Google Trends on Coronavirus Epidemic in Wuhan, China</title><secondary-title>arXiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>arXiv</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11021</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The recent emergence of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has gained a high cover in public media and worldwide news.

Here we report a 382-nt deletion covering almost the entire open reading frame 8 (ORF8) of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from eight hospitalized patients in Singapore. The deletion also removes the ORF8 transcription-regulatory sequence (TRS), which in turn enhances the downstream transcription of the N gene. We also found that viruses with the deletion have been circulating for at least four weeks. During the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003, a number of genetic variants were observed in the human population, and similar variation has since been observed across SARS-related CoVs in humans and bats. Overwhelmingly these viruses had mutations or deletions in ORF8, that have been associated with reduced replicative fitness of the virus. This is also consistent with the observation that towards the end of the outbreak sequences obtained from human SARS cases possessed an ORF8 deletion that may be associated with host adaptation. We therefore hypothesise that the major deletion revealed in this study may lead to an attenuated phenotype of SARS-CoV-2.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Su, Zhaoqian</author><author>Wu, Yinghao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Multiscale and Comparative Model for Receptor Binding of 2019 Novel Coronavirus and the Implication of its Life Cycle in Host Cells</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.20.958272</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.20.958272</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The respiratory syndrome caused by a new type of coronavirus has been emerging from China and caused more than 1000 death globally since December 2019. This new virus, called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) uses the same receptor called Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to attack humans as the coronavirus that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seventeen years ago. Both viruses recognize ACE2 through the spike proteins (S-protein) on their surfaces. It was found that the S-protein from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bind stronger to ACE2 than 2019-nCoV. However, function of a bio-system is often under kinetic, rather than thermodynamic, control. To address this issue, we constructed a structural model for complex formed between ACE2 and the S-protein from 2019-nCoV, so that the rate of their association can be estimated and compared with the binding of S-protein from SARS-CoV by a multiscale simulation method. Our simulation results suggest that the association of new virus to the receptor is slower than SARS, which is consistent with the experimental data obtained very recently. We further integrated this difference of association rate between virus and receptor into a mathematical model which describes the life cycle of virus in host cells and its interplay with the innate immune system. Interestingly, we found that the slower association between virus and receptor can result in longer incubation period, while still maintaining a relatively higher level of viral concentration in human body. Our computational study therefore provides, from the molecular level, one possible explanation that the new disease by far spread much faster than SARS.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Subspecialty Group of Gastroenterology, the Society of Pediatrics, Chinese Medical Association</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Prevention and control program on 2019 novel coronavirus infection in Children's digestive endoscopy center].</title><secondary-title>Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics</full-title></periodical><pages>E003</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>0</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>0578-1310 (Print) 0578-1310</isbn><accession-num>32023683</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.0578-1310.2020.0003</electronic-resource-num><notes>Subspecialty Group of Gastroenterology, the Society of Pediatrics, Chinese Medical Association

It has been designated as voluntary event cancellation (VEC). Object: This study predicts the effectiveness of VEC enduring and after its implementation. Method: We applied a simple susceptible−infected−recovery model to data of patients with symptoms in Japan during 14 January to VEC introduction and after VEC introduction to 8 March. We adjusted the reporting delay in the latest few days. Results: Results suggest that the basic reproduction number, R0, before VEC introduced as 2.50 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was [2.43, 2.55] and the effective reproduction number, Rv, after VEC introduced as 1. 88; its 95% CI was [1.68,2.02]. Discussion and Conclusion: Results demonstrated that VEC can reduce COVID−19 infectiousness by 35%, but R0 remains higher than one.

It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.

Other countries have since reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) importation from China, with some experiencing local transmission and even case importation from countries outside China. We aim to estimate the number of cases imported from Wuhan to each country or territory outside mainland China, and with these estimates assess the risk of onward local transmission and the relative potential of case importation between countries outside China. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from Wuhan and flight data to generate an uncertainty distribution for the estimated number of imported cases from Wuhan to each location outside mainland China. This uncertainty was propagated to quantify the local outbreak risk using a branching process model. A COVID-19 introduction index was derived for each pair of donor and recipient countries, accounting for the local outbreak risk in the donor country and the between-country connectivity. Results We identified 13 countries or territories outside mainland China that may have under-detected COVID-19 importation from Wuhan, such as Thailand and Indonesia. In addition, 16 countries had a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50%, including four outside Asia. The COVID-19 introduction index highlights potential locations outside mainland China from which cases may be imported to each recipient country. Conclusions As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, more epicentres may emerge outside China. Hence, it is important for countries to remain alert for the possibilities of viral introduction from other countries outside China, even before local transmission in a source country becomes known.

Here we present an effort to compile epidemiological information on 2019-nCoV from media news reports and a physician community website (dxy.cn) between Jan 20, 2020 and Jan 30, 2020, as the outbreak entered its 7th week. We compiled a line list of patients reported in China and internationally and daily case counts by Chinese province. We describe the demographics, hospitalization and reporting delays for 288 patients, over time and geographically. We find a decrease in case detection lags in provinces outside of Wuhan and internationally, compared to Wuhan, and after Jan 18, 2020, as outbreak awareness increased. The rapid progression of reported cases in different provinces of China is consistent with local transmission beyond Wuhan. The age profile of cases points at a deficit among children under 15 years of age, possibly related to prior immunity with related coronavirus or behavioral differences. Overall, our datasets, which have been publicly available since Jan 21, 2020, align with official reports from Chinese authorities published more than a week later. Availability of publicly available datasets in the early stages of an outbreak is important to encourage disease modeling efforts by independent academic modeling teams and provide robust evidence to guide interventions. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work was supported by the in house research program of the Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Within a few weeks, the disease caused by SARA-CoV-2, which is named COVID-19, has escalated into an unprecedented ongoing outbreak with frightening speed, becoming a global health emergency. This study aimed to exam the prevalence and risk factors of acute posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in Chinese people shortly after the massive outbreak of COVID-19. Method An online anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted in mainland China between 30 January and 3 February, 2020. The survey consisted of two self-administered questionnaires: one was designed to require personal information (gender, age, education background), current location, recent exposure history of Wuhan, the classification of population, and subjective sleep quality; the other was the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), which was to assess PTSS referring to the outbreak. Results A total of 2091 Chinese participated in the current study. The prevalence of PTSS among the public in mainland China 1 month after the COVID-19 outbreak was 4.6%. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that gender (p &lt; 0.001), exposure history of Wuhan (p = 0.047), classification of population (p &lt; 0.001), and subjective sleep quality (p &lt; 0.001) could be regarded as predictor factors for PTSS. Conclusions The results showed that some Chinese showed acute PTSS during the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, comprehensive psychological intervention needs further implementation. Furthermore, females, people who having recent exposure history of Wuhan, those at high risk of infection or with poor sleep quality deserve special attention.

Methods: A self-report inventory, the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), was used to investigate the mental health status of 548 medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus pneumonia in eight provinces and cities of China. Results: The overall mean SCL-90 score and mean values of factors (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of the medical personnel were significantly higher than in the norm group (p &lt; 0.05), while their average interpersonal sensitivity score was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.01). In addition, personal factors affecting the mental health status of medical personnel were identified. ( all p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The overall mental health status of medical personnel responding to new coronavirus pneumonia is generally higher than that of the norm group in China. The results of this study should contribute to measures to alleviate the psychological pressures on medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus epidemic in China ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Clinical Trial the research is not an clinical trial.Permission to conduct the study and to obtain access for the purpose of gathering the data were obtained from by the Ethics Committee of Harbin Medical University(HRBYKD-A26). ### Funding Statement no external funding was received ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases were searched. Several studies on the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection were collected for Meta-analysis. Results: Ten studies were included in Meta-analysis, including a total number of 50466 patients with 2019-nCoV infection. Meta-analysis shows that, among these patients, the incidence of fever was 89.1%, the incidence of cough was 72.2%, and the incidence of muscle soreness or fatigue was 42.5%. The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 14.8%, the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 96.6%, the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 18.1%, and the case fatality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection was 4.3%. Conclusion: Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and most of these patients have abnormal chest CT examination. Several people have muscle soreness or fatigue as well as ARDS. Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms only occur in a small number of patients. The case fatality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection is lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Clinical Trial This is a meta-analysis. ### Funding Statement No external funding was received. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Chi-square test was used to analyze the age distribution, gender distribution and the relationship between the subsequent cases and the index cases. Results: 391 cases including 148 family index cases, 189 subsequent cases and 54 asymptomatic infected cases. The clinical symptoms between family index cases and subsequent cases are similar, fever is the most common symptoms in the two groups 114 (77.03%) and 92 (48.68%) respectively, the cases with diarrhea symptoms accounted for the least proportion, which were 7 (4.73%) and 5 (2.65%). The serial interval between the family index cases and the subsequent cases [M (P(25), P(75))] was 3.00 (1.00, 6.00) days. Family secondary attack rate for subsequent cases and asymptomatic infected cases are 31.61% and 43.20% respectively, the family secondary attack rate of the spouses of the family index cases is 63.87%, and are higher than that of their children (30.53%), parents (28.37%) and other family members (20.93%), the difference was statistically significant. Conclusion: 2019 novel coronavirus has shorter serial interval and higher family secondary attack rate, the secondary attack rate of spouses is higher than other family members. 目的： 分析浙江省新型冠状病毒肺炎家庭聚集性疫情的病例流行特征。 方法： 于中国疾病预防控制中心突发公共卫生事件报告系统中，获取浙江省新型冠状病毒肺炎聚集性疫情流行病学调查资料，包括无症状感染者在内的病例信息，确定家庭续发病例、引入病例、无症状感染者和家庭易感人数，并计算家庭续发率，以及家庭续发病例与引入病例的代间距。本研究共收集149起聚集性疫情，包含391例病例。比较续发病例和无症状感染者之间上述指标的差异。 结果： 391例病例中，家庭引入病例148例，续发病例189例，无症状感染者为54例。家庭引入病例与续发病例的临床症状表现相似，出现发热症状比例均最高，分别为114（77.03%）和92（48.68%），出现腹泻症状的病例所占比重均最少，分别为7（4.73%）和5例（2.65%）。家庭续发病例与引入病例的代间距[M（P(25)，P(75))]为3.00（1.00，6.00）d。家庭续发病例的家庭续发率为31.61%，无症状感染者的家庭续发率为43.20%。家庭引入病例的配偶的家庭续发率为63.87%，高于子女（30.53%）、父母（28.37%）和其他家庭成员（20.93%）的续发率，差异有统计学意义（P&lt;0.001）。 结论： 浙江省新型冠状病毒肺炎的代间距较短，家庭续发率较高，配偶的家庭续发率高于其他家庭成员。.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Xufang</author><author>Zhang, Xian</author><author>Chen, Xuhui</author><author>Chen, Liwen</author><author>Deng, Chaohua</author><author>Zou, Xiaojing</author><author>Liu, Weiyong</author><author>Yu, Huimin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The infection evidence of SARS-COV-2 in ocular surface： a single-center cross-sectional study</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.26.20027938</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.26.20027938</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Purpose: The aim of this study was to identify whether SARS-COV-2 infected in ocular surface. Methods: Cross-sectional study of patients presenting for who received a COVID-19 diagnosis, from December 30, 2019 to February 7, 2020, at Tongji hospital, Tongji medical college, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Demographics, temperature was recorded, blood routine test (Rt), chest Computed Tomography (CT) were took intermittently, and SARS-COV-2 real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay were arranged for the nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swab samples. Results: A total of 102 patients (48 Male [50%] and 54 Female [50%]) with clinical symptoms, Rt, and chest Computed Tomography (CT) abnormalities were identified with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients had a mean [SD] gestational age of 57.63 [14.90] years. Of a total of 102 patients identified, 72 patients (36 men [50%] and 36 women [50%]; mean [SD] age, 58.68 [14.81] years) confirmed by laboratory diagnosis with SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR assay. Only two patients (2.78%) with conjunctivitis was identified from 72 patients with a laboratory confirmed COVID-19. However, SARS-COV-2 RNA fragments was found in ocular discharges by SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR only in one patient with conjunctivitis. Conclusions: Although we suspect the incidence of SARS-COV-2 infection through the ocular surface is extremely low, the nosocomial infection of SARS-CoV-2 through the eyes after occupational exposure is a potential route. The inefficient diagnostic method and the sampling time lag may contribute to the lower positive rate of conjunctival swab samples of SARS-COV-2. Therefore, to lower the SARS-COV-2 nosocomial infection, the protective goggles should be wore in all the health care workers.

To better understand viral tropism, we assessed the RNA expression of the coronavirus receptor, ACE2, as well as the viral S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 thought to govern viral entry in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from healthy individuals generated by the Human Cell Atlas consortium. We found that ACE2, as well as the protease TMPRSS2, are differentially expressed in respiratory and gut epithelial cells. In-depth analysis of epithelial cells in the respiratory tree reveals that nasal epithelial cells, specifically goblet/secretory cells and ciliated cells, display the highest ACE2 expression of all the epithelial cells analyzed. The skewed expression of viral receptors/entry-associated proteins towards the upper airway may be correlated with enhanced transmissivity. Finally, we showed that many of the top genes associated with ACE2 airway epithelial expression are innate immune-associated, antiviral genes, highly enriched in the nasal epithelial cells. This association with immune pathways might have clinical implications for the course of infection and viral pathology, and highlights the specific significance of nasal epithelia in viral infection. Our findings underscore the importance of the availability of the Human Cell Atlas as a reference dataset. In this instance, analysis of the compendium of data points to a particularly relevant role for nasal goblet and ciliated cells as early viral targets and potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This, in turn, serves as a biological framework for dissecting viral transmission and developing clinical strategies for prevention and therapy.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Suo, Tao</author><author>Liu, Xinjin</author><author>Guo, Ming</author><author>Feng, Jiangpeng</author><author>Hu, Wenjia</author><author>Yang, Yang</author><author>Zhang, Qiuhan</author><author>Wang, Xin</author><author>Sajid, Muhanmmad</author><author>Guo, Dong</author><author>Huang, Zhixiang</author><author>Deng, Liping</author><author>Chen, Tielong</author><author>Liu, Fang</author><author>Xu, Ke</author><author>Liu, Yuan</author><author>Zhang, Qi</author><author>Liu, Yingle</author><author>Xiong, Yong</author><author>Guo, Guozhong</author><author>Chen, Yu</author><author>Lan, Ke</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ddPCR: a more sensitive and accurate tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection in low viral load specimens</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.29.20029439</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.29.20029439</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) is widely used as the gold standard for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, due to the low viral load in patient throat and the limitation of RT-PCR, significant numbers of false negative reports are inevitable, which should not be ignored. Methods: We explored the feasibility of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 from 57 clinical pharyngeal swab samples and compared with RT-PCR in terms of the sensitivity and accuracy. Among 57 samples, all of which were reported as negative nucleic acid by officially approved clinical RT-PCR detection, 43 samples were collected from suspected patients with fever in clinic, and 14 were from supposed convalescents who were about to discharge after treatment. The experiment was double-blind. Results: The lower limit of detection of the optimized ddPCR is at least 500 times lower than that of RT-PCR. The overall accuracy of ddPCR for clinical detection is 94.3 %. 33 out of 35 negative pharyngeal swab samples checked by RT-PCR were correctly judged by ddPCR based on the follow-up investigation. In addition, 9 out of 14 (64.2 %) supposed convalescents with negative nucleic acid test twice by RT-PCR were positive by ddPCR detection. Conclusions: ddPCR shows superiority for clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the false negatives, which could be a powerful complement to the current standard RT-PCR. Before the ddPCR to be approved for diagnosis, the current clinical practice that the convalescent continues to be quarantined for 2 weeks is reasonable and necessary.

Knowledge about the duration of viral shedding remains important for patient management and infection control. We report the duration of viral detection in throat and rectum of a COVID-19 patient treated at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Despite clinical recovery, SARS-CoV-2 RNA remained detectable by real time RT-PCR in throat and rectal swabs until day 11 and 18 of hospitalization, respectively. Because live SARS-CoV-2 has been successfully isolated from a stool sample from a COVID-19 patient in China, the results demonstrate that COVID-19 patients may remain infectious for long periods, and fecal-oral transmission may be possible. Therefore, our finding has important implications for infection control. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This study was funded by the Wellcome Trust of Great Britain (106680/B/14/Z and 204904/Z/16/Z). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Identification of a simple and effective indicator to assess disease severity and outcome is urgently needed. Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed dynamic changes of lymphocyte percentage (LYM%) in 15 death cases, 15 severe cases as well as 40 moderate cases of COVID-19 patients. Next, prognostic role of lymphopenia in COVID-19 were verified in 92 hospitalized cases. Results: Our results from death and severe cases showed that LYM% in blood test were inversely associated with the progression and severity of COVID-19. LYM% in patients with moderate COVID-19 remained higher than 20% 10-12 days after symptom onset. In contrast, LYM% was lower than 20% in severe cases. However, LYM% in severe cases was higher than 5% 17-19 days after the onset of the disease, while it fell below 5% in death cases. Therefore, we established a reliable Time from symptom onset-LYM% model (TLM), which could be used to evaluate disease severity and predict the outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: Lymphopenia can be used to indicate clinical course, treatment effect and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Clinical Trial N/V ### Funding Statement This work was supported by the award numbers cstc2017jcyjBX0071 (H.M.) from the Foundation and Frontier Research Project of Chongqing and T04010019 (H.M.) from Chongqing youth top talent project. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

By using genomic, sequence, structural and evolutionary analysis, we show that Alpha- and Beta-CoVs possess several novel families of immunoglobulin (Ig) domain proteins, including ORF8 and ORF7a from SARS-related coronaviruses and two protein groups from certain Alpha-CoVs. Among them, ORF8 is distinguished in being rapidly evolving, possessing a unique insert and a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its predicted ligand-binding groove. We also uncover many Ig proteins from several metazoan viruses which are distinct in sequence and structure but share an architecture comparable to that of CoV Ig domain proteins. Hence, we propose that deployment of Ig domain proteins is a widely-used strategy by viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a potential pathogenicity factor which evolves rapidly to counter the immune response and facilitate the transmission between hosts.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, An</author><author>Tong, Zhen-dong</author><author>Wang, Hong-ling</author><author>Dai, Ya-xin</author><author>Li, Ke-feng</author><author>Liu, Jie-nan</author><author>Wu, Wen-jie</author><author>Yuan, Chen</author><author>Yu, Meng-lu</author><author>Li, Peng</author><author>Yan, Jian-bo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Detection of Novel Coronavirus by RT-PCR in Stool Specimen from Asymptomatic Child, China</title><secondary-title>Emerging Infectious Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Emerging Infectious Diseases</full-title></periodical><volume>26</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Emerg Infect Dis</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.3201/eid2606.200301</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0301_article.htm</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, Anjue</author><author>Xu, Wenhui</author><author>shen, min</author><author>Chen, Peifen</author><author>Li, Guobao</author><author>Liu, Yingxia</author><author>Liu, Lei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A retrospective study of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in 26 children</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.08.20029710</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.08.20029710</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in China began in December 2019. Studies on novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were less based on pediatric patients. This study aimed to reveal the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children. Method: This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical symptoms, laboratory results, chest CT, and treatment of children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19(ie, with samples that were positive for 2019 novel coronavirus[2019-nCoV]) who were admitted to Shenzhen Center of National Infectious Disease Clinical Medical Research from January 16 to February 8, 2020. Result: Nine patients had no obvious clinical symptom. 11 patients developed fever. Other symptoms, including cough(in eleven of seventeen patients), rhinorrhea(in two), diarrhea(in two), vomiting(in two), were also observed. A small minority of patients had lymphocytopenia. Alanine transaminase or transaminase increased in three cases. According to chest CT scan, 11 patients showed unilateral pneumonia, 8 patients had no pulmonary infiltration. No serious complications such as acute respiratory syndrome and acute lung injury occurred in all patients. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children were different from adult. The overall condition of children were mild and have a good prognosis.

Estimation of the basic reproduction number by means of mathematical modeling can be helpful for determining the potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity. A deterministic compartmental model was devised based on the clinical progression of the disease, epidemiological status of the individuals, and intervention measures. The estimations based on likelihood and model analysis show that the control reproduction number may be as high as 6.47 (95% CI 5.71–7.23). Sensitivity analyses show that interventions, such as intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the control reproduction number and transmission risk, with the effect of travel restriction adopted by Wuhan on 2019-nCoV infection in Beijing being almost equivalent to increasing quarantine by a 100 thousand baseline value. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures implemented by the Chinese authorities can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection, and how long they should be maintained. Under the most restrictive measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks (since 23 January 2020) with a significant low peak value. With travel restriction (no imported exposed individuals to Beijing), the number of infected individuals in seven days will decrease by 91.14% in Beijing, compared with the scenario of no travel restriction.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, Biao</author><author>Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi</author><author>Li, Qian</author><author>Tang, Sanyi</author><author>Xiao, Yanni</author><author>Wu, Jianhong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An updated estimation of the risk of transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov)</title><secondary-title>Infectious Disease Modelling</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Infectious Disease Modelling</full-title></periodical><pages>248-255</pages><volume>5</volume><keywords><keyword>Basic reproduction number</keyword><keyword>Effective daily reproduction ratio</keyword><keyword>Emerging and reemerging pathogens</keyword><keyword>Mathematical modeling</keyword><keyword>Novel coronavirus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>KeAi Communications Co.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.idm.2020.02.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S246804272030004X</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The basic reproduction number of an infectious agent is the average number of infections one case can generate over the course of the infectious period, in a naïve, uninfected population. It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised. By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th, 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak. Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation. The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, Biao</author><author>Wang, Xia</author><author>Li, Qian</author><author>Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi</author><author>Tang, Sanyi</author><author>Xiao, Yanni</author><author>Wu, Jianhong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimation of the transmission risk of 2019-nCov and its implication for public health interventions</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://ssrn.com/abstract=3525558</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, Biao</author><author>Xia, Fan</author><author>Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi</author><author>Wang, Xia</author><author>He, Sha</author><author>Sun, Xiaodan</author><author>Tang, Sanyi</author><author>Xiao, Yanni</author><author>Wu, Jianhong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lessons drawn from China and South Korea for managing COVID-19 epidemic: insights from a comparative modeling study</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.09.20033464</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.09.20033464</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>We conducted a comparative study of COVID-19 epidemic in three different settings: mainland China, the Guangdong province of China and South Korea, by formulating two disease transmission dynamics models incorporating epidemic characteristics and setting-specific interventions, and fitting the models to multi-source data to identify initial and effective reproduction numbers and evaluate effectiveness of interventions. We estimated the initial basic reproduction number for South Korea, the Guangdong province and mainland China as 2.6 (95% confidence interval (CI): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95%CI: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95%CI: (3.5,4.2)), respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days. We found that the effective reproduction number for the Guangdong province and mainland China has fallen below the threshold 1 since February 8th and 18th respectively, while the effective reproduction number for South Korea remains high, suggesting that the interventions implemented need to be enhanced in order to halt further infections. We also project the epidemic trend in South Korea under different scenarios where a portion or the entirety of the integrated package of interventions in China is used. We show that a coherent and integrated approach with stringent public health interventions is the key to the success of containing the epidemic in China and specially its provinces outside its epicenter, and we show that this approach can also be effective to mitigate the burden of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. The experience of outbreak control in mainland China should be a guiding reference for the rest of the world including South Korea.

The detection and diagnosis have been improved as well. However, the daily reported cases staying in a high level make the epidemics trend prediction difficult. METHODS Since the traditional SEIR model does not evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies, a novel model in line with the current epidemics process and control measures was proposed, utilizing multisource datasets including cumulative number of reported, death, quarantined and suspected cases. RESULTS Results show that the trend of the epidemics mainly depends on quarantined and suspected cases. The predicted cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases nearly reached static states and their inflection points have already been achieved, with the epidemics peak coming soon. The estimated effective reproduction numbers using model-free and model-based methods are decreasing, as well as new infections, while new reported cases are increasing. Most infected cases have been quarantined or put in suspected class, which has been ignored in existing models. CONCLUSIONS The uncertainty analyses reveal that the epidemics is still uncertain and it is important to continue enhancing the quarantine and isolation strategy and improving the detection rate in mainland China.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, Bowen</author><author>He, Fengming</author><author>Liu, Dongpeng</author><author>Fang, Meijuan</author><author>Wu, Zhen</author><author>Xu, Dong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>AI-aided design of novel targeted covalent inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.03.972133</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.03.972133</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The focused drug repurposing of known approved drugs (such as lopinavir/ritonavir) has been reported failed for curing SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

The epidemic scale in Shaanxi was comparatively small and with half of cases being imported from the epicenter. Based on the complete epidemic data including the symptom onset time and transmission chains, we calculate the control reproduction number (1.48-1.69) in Xian. We could also compute the time transition, for each imported or local case, from the latent, to infected, to hospitalized compartment, as well as the effective reproduction number. This calculation enables us to revise our early deterministic transmission model to a stochastic discrete epidemic model with case importation and parameterize it. Our model-based analyses reveal that the newly generated infections decay to zero quickly; the cumulative number of case-driven quarantined individuals via contact tracing stabilize at a manageable level, indicating that the intervention strategies implemented in the Shaanxi province have been effective. Risk analyses, important for the consideration of resumption of work, show that a large second outbreak is expected if the level of case importation remains at the same level as between January 10th and February 4th 2020. However, if the case importation decreases by 30%, 60% and 90%, the second outbreak if happening will be of small-scale assuming contact tracing and quarantine/isolation remain as effective as before. Finally, we consider the effects of intermittent inflow with a Poisson distribution on the likelihood of multiple outbreaks. We believe the developed methodology and stochastic model provide an important model framework for the evaluation of revising travel restriction rules in the consideration of resuming social-economic activities while managing the disease control with potential case importation.

Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main routes of transmission of new coronaviruses. Compared with SARS and Ebola viruses, new coronavirus infections are infectious during the incubation period. Traditional SEIR (susceptibility-exposure-infection-Removal) There are some differences in conditions for the prediction of the epidemic trend of new coronavirus infection. The outbreak of the new coronavirus infection coincided with the Spring Festival before and after the Chinese Spring Festival.It is necessary to make appropriate optimization and amendments to the traditional model to meet the actual evolution of the epidemic situation. METHODS The traditional SEIR model assumes that the virus-infected person is not infectious during the incubation period and that the infected person did not take isolation measures during the illness. The transmission of the new coronavirus no longer meets the basic assumptions of the classical kinetic system. Therefore, this article first establishes a modified SEIR model. Predict and analyze the changing trend of the epidemic situation, then estimate the parameters involved in the infection dynamics model, and then use Matlab to simulate the established dynamic equations based on public data and analyze the results. Recommendations for universal prevention and control of infectious diseases. RESULTS The first case of new coronavirus infection was confirmed in Wuhan on December 8, 2019. When Wuhan City took no action, assuming the average daily number of contacts per infected person k = 5, the number of infected persons will reach about 2,384,803 people; If wuhan adopts the measures of sealing the city on January 22, 2020, under the premise of k=2, the number of infected people decreases by 19,773 compared with that on January 23, and there is no significant change in the time when the number of infected people reaches the peak. Under the premise of k = 1, the number of infected persons was reduced by 14,330 compared with the closure on January 23, and the time to reach the peak of the number of infected persons was reduced by 2 days. If Wuhan City is closed for one day, the number of infected persons will increase from 106,145 to 130,626 under the premise of k = 2; the number of infected persons will increase from 74,369 to 92,010 under the premise of k = 1. CONCLUSIONS Comparing the number of confirmed diagnoses actually notified by the department with the number of infected people obtained from the simulation of the model, it can be seen that the city closure measures adopted by the Wuhan Municipal Government on January 23 and the first-level response measures adopted by the country are effective for the epidemic Prevention and control play a vital role. Wearing a mask when going out and avoiding close contact with people can effectively reduce the infection rate.

Therefore, it is significant to understand the epidemiological characteristics of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective and observational study, we collected data from 167 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection treated in Chongqing Public Health Medical Center (Chongqing, China) from January to March 2020. The epidemiological characteristics and variable of these patients were collected and analyzed. Findings: 82.04% of the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients had a travel history in Wuhan or a history of contact with returnees from Wuhan, showing typical characteristics of imported cases, and the proportion of severe Covid-19 patients was 13.2%, of which 59% were imported from Wuhan. For the patients who was returnees from Wuhan, 18.1% was asymptomatic patients. In different infection periods, compared with the proportion after 1/31/2020, the proportion of asymptomatic patient among SARS-CoV-2 infected patient was higher(19% VS 1.5%). In different age groups, the proportion of asymptomatic patient was the highest(28.6%) in children group under 14, next in elder group over 70 (27.3%). Compared with mild and common Covid-19 patients, the mean latency of asymptomatic was longer (11.25 days VS 8.86 days), but the hospital length of stay was shorter (14.3 days VS 16.96 days) . Conclusion: The SARS-CoV-2 prevention needs to focus on the screening of asymptomatic patients in the community with a history of contact with the imported population, especially for children and the elderly population.

If it exceeds 1, the number of incident cases will inevitably grow over time, and a large epidemic is possible. To prevent the expansion of an epidemic, R must be reduced to a level below 1. To estimate the reproduction number, the probability distribution function of the generation interval of an infectious disease is required to be available; however, this distribution is often unknown. In this letter, given the incomplete information for the generation interval, we propose a maximum entropy method to estimate the reproduction number. Based on this method, given the mean value and variance of the generation interval, we first determine its probability distribution function and in turn estimate the real-time values of reproduction number of COVID-19 in China. By applying these estimated reproduction numbers into the susceptible-infectious-removed epidemic model, we simulate the evolutionary track of the epidemic in China, which is well in accordance with that of the real incident cases. The simulation results predict that China's epidemic will gradually tend to disappear by May 2020 if the quarantine measures can continue to be executed.

This highlights the need to monitor transmission potential of unfolding SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in real time. In particular, five major COVID-19 clusters have emerged in Singapore. Here we estimate the effective reproduction number, Rt, for Singapore from the daily case series of imported and autochthonous cases by date of symptoms onset, after adjusting the local cases for reporting delays, using a generalized growth model and employing a renewal equation. We also derive the reproduction number from the distribution of cluster sizes using a branching process analysis. As of February 19th, 2020, our results indicate that the mean effective reproduction number Rt is at 1.1 (95% CI: 1.1,1.3) while an estimate of Rt based on cluster size distribution is at 0.63 (95% CI: 0.4, 1.05). These estimates underscore positive impact of containment efforts in Singapore while at the same time suggest the need to sustain social distancing and active case finding efforts to stomp out all active chains of transmission. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement G.C. is supported by NSF grants 1610429 and 1633381. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

This impedes global research cooperation, which is essential for tackling public health emergencies, and requires unimpeded access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure. Here we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past ten years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use all COVID-19 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and to (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises.

One of the questions many policy makers, and governments are asking themselves is how the spread is going to evolve in time. In this study, I applied an adapted SIR model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also caused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases in the case of the Portuguese situation, using Italian dara. I then construct five different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal. In the out of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000 people on the 5th of April (out-of-control scenario). If the self-protective and control are taken in the same level as what was considered for the South Korean model, this number could have be reduced to about 800 cases (scenario 1). Considering that this scenario is now unrealistic, three other scenarios were devised. In all these scenarios, the government measures had a 50\% effectiveness when compared to the measures in Korea. But in scenario 2 the transmission rate $\beta$ was effectively reduced to 50\%, In this scenario active cases could reach circa 7,000 people. In scenario 3, the transmission rate $\beta$ was reduced to 70\% of its initial value, in which the number of cases would reach a peak of ~11,000 people. And finally in scenario 4, $\beta$ was reduced to 80\%. In this scenario, the peak would be reached at about ~13,000 cases. This study shows the importance of control and self-protecting measure to bring down the number of affected people by following the recommendations of the WHO and health authorities. With the appropriate measures, this number can be brought down to ~7,000-13,000 people. Hopefully that will be the case not just in Portugal, but in the rest of the World.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Teles, Pedro</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>PREDICTING THE EVOLUTION OF COVID-19 IN PORTUGAL USING AN ADAPTED SIR MODEL PREVIOUSLY USED IN SOUTH KOREA FOR THE MERS OUTBREAK</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.18.20038612</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.18.20038612</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Since original reports in Wuhan, China, the new coronavirus covid-19 has spread very quickly worldwide, leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a state of pandemic. Moreover, as of the 13th of March 2020, the WHO has announced that the European continent is now the main centre of the pandemic. Many European governments have already implemented harsh measures to attempt to contain the spread of the virus. In Portugal, there are, as of the 18th of March 2020, 642 confirmed cases. In this study, I applied an adapted SIR model previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbrake, which is also caused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases in the case of the Portuguese situation. As some of the parameters were unknown, and the data for Portugal is still scarce, given that the outbreak started later (first case on the 2nd of March) I used Italian data (first reported case in Italy on the 31st of January) to predict them. I then construct two or three different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal, considering both the effectiveness of the mitigation measurements implemented by the government, and the self-protective measures taken by the population, as explained in the South Korean model. In the out of control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000 people by the beginning of April. If measures are appropriately taken this number can be reduced to about 700 cases. In case that some measures are taken, but their implementation is not done appropriately, the active cases could reach circa 7,000 people. The actual figures probably lie between the interval (~700-7,000) and the peak will be reached between 9th and the 20nd of April 2020.

Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the increased seasonal influenza activity. Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses. Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government interventions can only delay the peak. Interpretation: Handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination about COVID-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. We stress the importance of a rapid spread of awareness on the use of self-imposed prevention measures in the population. Early-initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden.

Large RNA virus genomes, such as from Coronaviruses, are cumbersome to clone and to manipulate in E. coli hosts due to size and occasional instability. Therefore, an alternative rapid and robust reverse genetics platform for RNA viruses would benefit the research community. Here we show the full functionality of a yeast-based synthetic genomics platform for the genetic reconstruction of diverse RNA viruses, including members of the Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae and Paramyxoviridae families. Viral subgenomic fragments were generated using viral isolates, cloned viral DNA, clinical samples, or synthetic DNA, and reassembled in one step in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using transformation associated recombination (TAR) cloning to maintain the genome as a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC). T7-RNA polymerase has been used to generate infectious RNA, which was then used to rescue viable virus. Based on this platform we have been able to engineer and resurrect chemically-synthetized clones of the recent epidemic SARS-CoV-2 in only a week after receipt of the synthetic DNA fragments. The technical advance we describe here allows to rapidly responding to emerging viruses as it enables the generation and functional characterization of evolving RNA virus variants - in real-time - during an outbreak.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>The 2019-nCoV Outbreak Joint Field Epidemiology Investigation Team</author><author>Li, Qun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Notes from the Field An Outbreak of NCIP ( 2019-nCoV ) Infection in China — Wuhan , Hubei Province , 2019 − 2020</title><secondary-title>China CDC Weekly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>China CDC Weekly</full-title></periodical><pages>79-80</pages><volume>110</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://An+Outbreak+of+NCIP+(2019-nCoV)+Infection+in+China+—+Wuhan,+Hubei+Province,+2019−2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>The, Lancet</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Emerging understandings of 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>The Lancet</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet</full-title></periodical><keywords/><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30186-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30186-0</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;group author;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thevarajan, Irani</author><author>Nguyen, Thi Ho</author><author>Koutsakos, Marios</author><author>Druce, Julian</author><author>Caly, Leon</author><author>Sandt, Carolien E van de</author><author>Jia, Xiaoxiao</author><author>Nicholson, Suellen</author><author>Catton, Mike</author><author>Cowie, Benjamin</author><author>Tong, Steven</author><author>Lewin, Sharon</author><author>Kedzierska, Katherine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Breadth of concomitant immune responses underpinning viral clearance and patient recovery in a non-severe case of COVID-19</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.20.20025841</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.20.20025841</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>We report the kinetics of the immune response in relation to clinical and virological features of a patient with mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) requiring hospitalisation.

In addition to quarantine measures for returning citizens, many countries implemented PCR screening to test for infection regardless of symptoms. These flights therefore give estimates of infection prevalence in Wuhan over time. Between 30 th January and 1 st February (close to the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan), infection prevalence was 0.87% (95% CI: 0.32%-1.89%). As countries now start to repatriate citizens from Iran and northern Italy, information from repatriated citizens could help inform the level of response necessary to help control the outbreaks unfolding in newly affected areas. 1. Background Following the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19, formerly 2019-nCoV) in Wuhan City, China and the subsequent travel and movement restrictions implemented in the city, foreign governments began the process of chartering flights to repatriate citizens from the epicentre of the outbreak. These flights began on 29th January 2020 and continued throughout February with the last flight returning on 27 th February 2020. In addition to quarantining citizens returning on these flights to prevent any potential secondary transmission after arrival, many countries implemented PCR screening of returning citizens to test for infection. These repatriation flights therefore provide snapshots of the infection prevalence over time and insights into the levels of transmission in Wuhan City. We present an overview of these repatriation flights within this timeframe. Information on: i) the number of individuals repatriated; ii) their destination country; iii) whether individuals were tested for the pathogen responsible for COVID-19 regardless of symptoms; iv) and their outcomes where available were sourced from publicly available sources. These are provided in a supplementary data file.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thompson, R N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>2019-20 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak: Intense surveillance is vital for preventing sustained transmission in new locations</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.24.919159</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.24.919159</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.24.919159</url><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/25/2020.01.24.919159.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The outbreak of pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, has generated 830 confirmed cases, including 26 deaths, as of 24 January 2020.

The virus belongs to the beta genus Coronavirus in the family Corornaviridae, and is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing severe symptoms of pneumonia. The virus is transmitted through droplets, close contact, and other means, and patients in the incubation period could potentially transmit the virus to other persons. According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it's mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV. After the outbreak of this disease, Chinese scientists invested a lot of energy to carry out research by developing rapid diagnostic reagents, identifying the characters of the pathogen, screening out clinical drugs that may inhibit the virus, and are rapidly developing vaccines. The emergence of 2019-nCoV reminds us once again of the importance of establishing a systematic coronavirus surveillance network. It also poses new challenges to prevention and control of the emerging epidemic and rapidly responses on scientific research.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tian, Huaiyu</author><author>Li, Yidan</author><author>Liu, Yonghong</author><author>Kraemer, Moritz U.

On January 23rd 2020 China shut down transit in and out of Wuhan, a major transport hub and conurbation of 11 million inhabitants, to contain the outbreak. By combining epidemiological and human mobility data we find that the travel ban slowed the dispersal of nCoV from Wuhan to other cities in China by 2.91 days (95% CI: 2.54-3.29). This delay provided time to establish and reinforce other control measures that are essential to halt the epidemic. The ongoing dissemination of 2019-nCoV provides an opportunity to examine how travel restrictions impede the spatial dispersal of an emerging infectious disease. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement Funding for this study was provided by the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (JQ18025); Beijing Advanced Innovation Program for Land Surface Science; National Natural Science Foundation of China (81673234); Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST (YESS)(2018QNRC001) ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Contrary to mainstream views, there is growing literature on pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals contributing significantly to the disease outbreak. Several recent studies on serial infection yielded a mean interval of around 4 days, shorter than the mean symptom onset time of 5-7 days, and negative serial interval in more than 10% of the cases. These observations highlight the urgent need to quantify the pre-symptomatic transmission for adequate global response. In this paper, we develop an epidemic model driven by pre-symptomatic transmission. Within the model construct, the infectiousness of a viral carrier on a given day is identified with their symptom onset probability, which we characterise through extensive studies of the clinical literature. The well-known Lotka-Euler estimating equation can then be invoked to relate the daily growth rate $\lambda$ of the epidemic with the basic reproduction number $R_0$. We applied the disease spreading model to epidemic development in affected provinces across China following the Wuhan lockdown on January 23, 2020. The remarkable three-phase universal pattern can be well-captured by the model. Despite its simplicity, the model allows synthesis of data from diverse sources to form a quantitative understanding of key mechanisms that drive or contain the disease spreading, and to make informed decisions to bring the pandemic under control.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tian, Sufang</author><author>Hu, Weidong</author><author>Niu, Li</author><author>Liu, Huan</author><author>Xu, Haibo</author><author>Xiao, Shu-Yuan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pulmonary pathology of early phase 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia in two patients with lung cancer</title><secondary-title>Journal of Thoracic Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Thoracic Oncology</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>J Thorac Oncol</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jtho.2020.02.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1556086420301325</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tian, Xiaolong</author><author>Li, Cheng</author><author>Huang, Ailing</author><author>Xia, Shuai</author><author>Lu, Sicong</author><author>Shi, Zhengli</author><author>Lu, Lu</author><author>Jiang, Shibo</author><author>Yang, Zhenlin</author><author>Wu, Yanling</author><author>Ying, Tianlei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.01.28.923011</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.01.28.923011</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/01/28/2020.01.28.923011.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused more than 800 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 25 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health. Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. Therefore, CR3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g., m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, indicating that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tian, Xiaolong</author><author>Li, Cheng</author><author>Huang, Ailing</author><author>Xia, Shuai</author><author>Lu, Sicong</author><author>Shi, Zhengli</author><author>Lu, Lu</author><author>Jiang, Shibo</author><author>Yang, Zhenlin</author><author>Wu, Yanling</author><author>Ying, Tianlei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus-specific human monoclonal antibody</title><secondary-title>Emerging Microbes &amp; Infections</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Emerging Microbes &amp; Infections</full-title></periodical><pages>382-385</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>ACE2</keyword><keyword>RBD</keyword><keyword>SARS-CoV</keyword><keyword>monoclonal antibody</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Taylor &amp; Francis</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/22221751.2020.1729069</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2020.1729069</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>ABSTRACTThe newly identified 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has caused more than 11,900 laboratory-confirmed human infections, including 259 deaths, posing a serious threat to human health.

We determine the incubation period and serial interval distribution for transmission clusters in Singapore and in Tianjin. We infer the basic reproduction number and identify the extent of pre-symptomatic transmission. Methods: We collected outbreak information from Singapore and Tianjin, China, reported from Jan.19-Feb.26 and Jan.21-Feb.27, respectively. We estimated incubation periods and serial intervals in both populations. Results: The mean incubation period was 7.1 (6.13, 8.25) days for Singapore and 9 (7.92, 10.2)days for Tianjin. Both datasets had shorter incubation periods for earlier-occurring cases. The mean serial interval was 4.56 (2.69, 6.42) days for Singapore and 4.22 (3.43, 5.01) for Tianjin. We inferred that early in the outbreaks, infection was transmitted on average 2.55 and 2.89days before symptom onset (Singapore, Tianjin). The estimated basic reproduction number for Singapore was 1.97 (1.45, 2.48) secondary cases per infective; for Tianjin it was 1.87 (1.65,2.09) secondary cases per infective. Conclusions: Estimated serial intervals are shorter than incubation periods in both Singapore and Tianjin, suggesting that pre-symptomatic transmission is occurring. Shorter serial intervals lead to lower estimates of R0, which suggest that half of all secondary infections should be prevented to control spread.

The equations of the model include the description of compartments like Susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious but not yet symptomatic (pre-symptomatic) (A), infectious with symptoms (I), hospitalized (H) and recovered (R). Further stratification includes quarantined susceptible (Sq), isolated exposed (Eq) and isolated infected (Iq) compartments. The equations are numerically solved for boundary (initial) conditions tuned on the Italian event. The role of quarantine is specifically emphasized and supports the strategies adopted providing a numerical description of the effects.

During the interval between February 19 and 23, 2020, Iran reported its first 43 cases with eight deaths. Three exported cases originating in Iran were identified, suggesting a underlying burden of disease in that country than is indicated by reported cases. A large epidemic in Iran could further fuel global dissemination of COVID-19. We sought to estimate COVID-19 outbreak size in Iran based on known exported case counts and air travel links between Iran and other countries, and to anticipate where infections originating in Iran may spread to next. We assessed interconnectivity between Iran and other countries using using International Air Transport Association (IATA) data. We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic that would result in cases being observed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, and Canada. Time at risk estimates were based on a presumed 6 week epidemic age, and length of stay data for visitors to Iran derived from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). We evaluated the relationship between the strength of travel links with Iran, and destination country rankings on the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), a validated metric that estimates the capacity of a country to respond to an infectious disease outbreak . Scores range between 0-1, with higher scores reflecting greater capacity to manage infectious outbreaks. UAE, Lebanon, and Canada ranked 3rd, 21st, and 31st, respectively, for outbound air travel volume from Iran in February 2019. We estimated that 18,300 (95% confidence interval: 3770 to 53,470) COVID-19 cases would have had to occur in Iran, assuming an outbreak duration of 1.5 months in the country, in order to observe these three internationally exported cases reported at the time of writing. Results were robust under varying assumptions about undiagnosed case numbers in Syria, Azerbaijan and Iraq. Even if it were assumed that all cases were identified in all countries with certainty, the &quot;best case&quot; outbreak size was substantial (1820, 95% CI: 380-5320 cases), and far higher than reported case counts. Given the low volumes of air travel to countries with identified cases of COVID-19 with origin in Iran (such as Canada), it is likely that Iran is currently experiencing a COVID-19 epidemic of significant size for such exportations to be occurring. This is concerning, both for public health in Iran itself, and because of the high likelihood for outward dissemination of the epidemic to neighbouring countries with lower capacity to respond to infectious diseases epidemics.

During the interval between February 25-29, 2020, we identified 46 cases of COVID-19 reported in 21 countries in Europe, Africa, North America, and South America which were either in individuals with recent travel from Italy, or who had presumed infection by a traveler from Italy 2. In six cases, in four of the affected countries (Switzerland, France, Austria, Croatia), land travel was a likely route of introduction, or was documented to have been the route of introduction. We used air travel volume between Italian cities and cities in other countries as an index of connectedness, using data available from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) for February 2015 (2.61 million total departing international air passengers from Italy). We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic in Italy necessary in order for these cases to be observed with a reasonable probability. To estimate the time at risk of COVID-19 exposure for travelers departing Italy, we obtained data from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) for the proportion of international travelers that are non-residents of Italy (63%) and the average length of stay of tourists to Italy (3.4 days), and assumed the Italian epidemic began one month prior to February 29, 2020. We also performed sensitivity analyses in which we included outbound travel to all countries regardless of reported case importations, inflated travel volumes by 35%, to account for the relative increase in flight numbers from 2015-2019, and excluded cases in bordering countries and which were documented to have been introduced by overland travel. When all cases were considered we estimated a true outbreak size of 3971 cases (95% CI 2907-5297), as compared to a reported case count of 1128 on February 29, 2020, suggesting non-identification of 72% (61-79%) of cases. In sensitivity analyses, outbreak sizes varied from 1552 to 4533 cases (implying non-identification of 27-75% of cases). We recently used similar methods to estimate a much larger epidemic size in Iran, with a far greater degree of under-reporting, based on many fewer exported cases. The reason for this difference relates to the relatively high volume of travel from Italy, relative to Iran. In summary, we suggest that the numerous COVID-19 case exportations from Italy in recent days suggest an epidemic that is larger than official case counts suggest, and which is approximately on a par with that currently occurring in South Korea, which reports 3526 cases (and fewer deaths) as of February 29, 2020.

Here, we investigate the stability of viable HCoV-19 on surfaces and in aerosols in comparison with SARS-CoV-1. Overall, stability is very similar between HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1. We found that viable virus could be detected in aerosols up to 3 hours post aerosolization, up to 4 hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel. HCoV-19 and SARS-CoV-1 exhibited similar half-lives in aerosols, with median estimates around 2.7 hours. Both viruses show relatively long viability on stainless steel and polypropylene compared to copper or cardboard: the median half-life estimate for HCoV-19 is around 13 hours on steel and around 16 hours on polypropylene. Our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of HCoV-19 is plausible, as the virus can remain viable in aerosols for multiple hours and on surfaces up to days. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement .

Method: Study Identification was carried out in databases (PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library) to identify published studies examining the diagnosis, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Heterogeneity among reported prevalence was assessed by computing p-values of Cochrane Q-test and I2-statics. The pooled prevalence of treatment failure was carried out with a fixed effects meta-analysis model, generating the pooled 95% confidence interval. A random-effect model was used to pool the results since this model could incorporate the heterogeneity of the studies and therefore proved a more generalized result. Results: According to the combined results of meta-analysis, the total 55% of corona patients were males. The mean age of the patients was 41.31 (34.14, 48.47). Two prevalent clinical symptoms between patients were fever, cough with prevalence of 85%, and 62%, respectively. Either Ground Glass Opacity GGO or consolidation was seen in 86% but 14% had NO GGO or consolidation. The other rare CT symptoms were pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion with 4, 5, 7% prevalence, respectively. The most prevalent event was Either GGO or consolidation in 85% of patients. Conclusion: The most CT-scan abnormality is Either Ground Glass Opacity GGO or consolidation however in few patients none of them might be observed, so trusting in just CT findings will lead to miss some patients.

The 2019-nCoV represents a potential epidemic or pandemic threat, which requires a quick response for preparedness against this infection. The present report uses the informational spectrum methodology to identify the possible origin and natural host of the new virus, as well as putative therapeutic and vaccine targets. The performed in silico analysis indicates that the newly emerging 2019-nCoV is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and, to a lesser degree, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Moreover, the well-known SARS-CoV receptor (ACE2) might be a putative receptor for the novel virus as well. Actin protein was also suggested as a host factor that participates in cell entry and pathogenesis of 2019-nCoV; therefore, drugs modulating biological activity of this protein (e.g. ibuprofen) were suggested as potential candidates for treatment of this viral infection. Additional results indicated that civets and poultry are potential candidates for the natural reservoir of the 2019-nCoV, and that domain 288-330 of S1 protein from the 2019-nCoV represents promising therapeutic and/or vaccine target. </abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Verity, Robert</author><author>Okell, Lucy C</author><author>Dorigatti, Ilaria</author><author>Winskill, Peter</author><author>Whittaker, Charles</author><author>Imai, Natsuko</author><author>Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina</author><author>Thompson, Hayley</author><author>Walker, Patrick</author><author>Fu, Han</author><author>Dighe, Amy</author><author>Griffin, Jamie</author><author>Cori, Anne</author><author>Baguelin, Marc</author><author>Bhatia, Sangeeta</author><author>Boonyasiri, Adhiratha</author><author>Cucunuba, Zulma M</author><author>Fitzjohn, Rich</author><author>Gaythorpe, Katy A M</author><author>Green, Will</author><author>Hamlet, Arran</author><author>Hinsley, Wes</author><author>Laydon, Daniel</author><author>Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma</author><author>Riley, Steven</author><author>van-Elsand, Sabine</author><author>Volz, Erik</author><author>Wang, Haowei</author><author>Wang, Yuanrong</author><author>Xi, Xiayoue</author><author>Donnelly, Christl</author><author>Ghani, Azra</author><author>Ferguson, Neil</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimates of the severity of COVID-19 disease</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.09.20033357</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.09.20033357</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: A range of case fatality ratio (CFR) estimates for COVID 19 have been produced that differ substantially in magnitude. Methods: We used individual-case data from mainland China and cases detected outside mainland China to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the CFR by relating the aggregate distribution of cases by dates of onset to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for the demography of the population, and age and location-based under ascertainment. We additionally estimated the CFR from individual linelist data on 1,334 cases identified outside mainland China. We used data on the PCR prevalence in international residents repatriated from China at the end of January 2020 to obtain age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio (IFR). Using data on age stratified severity in a subset of 3,665 cases from China, we estimated the proportion of infections that will likely require hospitalisation. Findings: We estimate the mean duration from onset-of-symptoms to death to be 17.8 days (95% credible interval, crI 16.9,19.2 days) and from onset-of-symptoms to hospital discharge to be 22.6 days (95% crI 21.1,24.4 days). We estimate a crude CFR of 3.67% (95% crI 3.56%,3.80%) in cases from mainland China. Adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment of milder cases in Wuhan relative to the rest of China, we obtain a best estimate of the CFR in China of 1.38% (95% crI 1.23%,1.53%) with substantially higher values in older ages. Our estimate of the CFR from international cases stratified by age (under 60 or 60 and above) are consistent with these estimates from China. We obtain an overall IFR estimate for China of 0.66% (0.39%,1.33%), again with an increasing profile with age. Interpretation: These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and demonstrate a strong age-gradient in risk.

This implies that as a pandemic as declared by WHO (2020) the COVID-19 coronavirus does not have a curative vaccine yet and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observatory procedures. Also, the Basic Reproductive number (R\_0&lt;1) by Equation (33) shows that there is a chance of decline of secondary infections when the ratio between the incidence rate in the population and the total number of infected population quarantined with observatory procedure. The effort to evaluate the disease equilibrium shows that unless there is a dedicated effort from government, decision makers and stakeholders, the world would hardly be reed of the COVID-19 coronavirus and further spread is eminent and the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery because of the absence of vaccine at the moment.

In this brief note, we endeavour to assess the efficiency of quarantine measures by means of mathematical modelling. Instead of the classical SIR model, we introduce a new model of infection progression under the assumption that all infected individual are isolated after the incubation period in such a way that they cannot infect other people. Disease progression in this model is determined by the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ (the number of newly infected individuals during the incubation period), which is different compared to that for the standard SIR model. If $\mathcal{R}_0 &gt;1$, then the number of latently infected individuals exponentially grows. However, if $\mathcal{R}_0 &lt;1$ (e.g.~due to quarantine measures and contact restrictions imposed by public authorities), then the number of infected decays exponentially. We then consider the available data on the disease development in different countries to show that there are three possible patterns: growth dynamics, growth-decays dynamics, and patchy dynamics (growth-decay-growth). Analysis of the data in China and Korea shows that the peak of infection (maximum of daily cases) is reached about 10 days after the restricting measures are introduced. During this period of time, the growth rate of the total number of infected was gradually decreasing. However, the growth rate remains exponential in Italy. Arguably, it suggests that the introduced quarantine is not sufficient and stricter measures are needed.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volunteers, Anti-2019-nCoV</author><author>Li, Zhen</author><author>Wu, Ming</author><author>Guo, Jie</author><author>Yao, Jiwei</author><author>Liao, Xiang</author><author>Song, Siji</author><author>Han, Min</author><author>Li, Jiali</author><author>Duan, Guangjie</author><author>Zhou, Yuanxiu</author><author>Wu, Xiaojun</author><author>Zhou, Zhansong</author><author>Wang, Taojiao</author><author>Hu, Ming</author><author>Chen, Xianxiang</author><author>Fu, Yu</author><author>Lei, Chong</author><author>Dong, Hailong</author><author>Zhou, Yi</author><author>Jia, Hongbo</author><author>Chen, Xiaowei</author><author>Yan, Junan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Caution on Kidney Dysfunctions of 2019-nCoV Patients</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.08.20021212</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.08.20021212</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;group author;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Until 24:00 of February 7th 2020, 31774 laboratory-confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection have been reported, including 6101 severe cases in critical conditions and 722 deaths. The critical and urgent need at this moment is to find an effective treatment strategy with available means to prevent these thousands of severe inpatients from worsening and dying. It has been recently known that the 2019-nCoV shares a common cellular mechanism with the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Thus, we surveyed a previous retrospective case study on SARS which showed that acute renal impairment was uncommon in SARS but carried a formidably high mortality (91.7%, 33 of 36 cases). Here we report an ongoing case study on kidney functions in 59 patients infected by 2019-nCoV (including 28 diagnosed as severe cases and 3 deaths). 63% (32/51) of the patients exhibited proteinuria, indicative of renal impairment. 19% (11/59) and 27% (16/59) of the patients had an elevated level of plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen respectively. The computerized tomography (CT) scan showed radiographic abnormalities of the kidneys in 100% (27/27) of the patients. Together, these multiple lines of evidence point to the idea that renal impairment is common in 2019-nCov patients, which may be one of the major causes of the illness by the virus infection and also may contribute to multi-organ failure and death eventually. Therefore, we strongly suggest exercising a high degree of caution in monitoring the kidney functions of 2019-nCoV patients and, very importantly, that applying potential interventions including continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) for protecting kidney functions as early as possible, particular for those with plasma creatinine rising, is key to preventing fatality. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This study was supported by grants from the &quot;1000-Talents Program for Young Scholars&quot; of China (X.

By analysing 53 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences collected up to February 3, 2020, we find a strong association between the time of sample collection and accumulation of genetic diversity. Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic methods indicate that the virus was introduced into the human population in early December and has an epidemic doubling time of approximately seven days. Phylodynamic modelling provides an estimate of epidemic size through time. Precise estimates of epidemic size are not possible with current genetic data, but our analyses indicate evidence of substantial heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections caused by each case, as indicated by a high level of over-dispersion in the reproduction number. Larger numbers of more systematically sampled sequences-particularly from across China-will allow phylogenetic estimates of epidemic size and growth rate to be substantially refined.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Volz, Erik</author><author>Fu, Han</author><author>Wang, Haowei</author><author>Xi, Xiauoyue</author><author>Chen, Wei</author><author>Liu, Dehui</author><author>Chen, Yingying</author><author>Tian, Mengmeng</author><author>Tan, Wei</author><author>Zai, Junjie</author><author>Zan, Wanying</author><author>Li, Xinguang</author><author>Nie, Qing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genomic epidemiology of a densely sampled COVID19 outbreak in China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.09.20033365</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.09.20033365</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Volz et al. - 2020 - Genomic epidemiology of a densely sampled COVID19 outbreak in China.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Analysis of genetic sequence data from the pandemic SARS Coronavirus 2 can provide insights into epidemic origins, worldwide dispersal, and epidemiological history. With few exceptions, genomic epidemiological analysis has focused on geographically distributed data sets with few isolates in any given location. Here we report an analysis of 20 whole SARS-CoV 2 genomes from a single relatively small and geographically constrained outbreak in Weifang, People's Republic of China. Using Bayesian model-based phylodynamic methods, we estimate the reproduction number for the outbreak to be 1.99(95% CI:1.48-3.14). We further estimate the number of infections through time and compare these estimates to confirmed diagnoses by the Weifang Centers for Disease Control. We find that these estimates are consistent with reported cases and there is unlikely to be a large undiagnosed burden of infection over the period we studied. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work was supported by Centre funding from the UK Medical Research Council under a concordat with the UK Department for International Development.

Many metagenomic datasets are now available, with deep sequencing of samples from diverse biological niches. While any individual metagenomic dataset can be readily queried using web-based tools, meta-searches through all such datasets are less accessible. In this brief communication, we demonstrate such a meta-meta-genomic approach, examining close matches to the Wuhan coronavirus 2019-nCoV in all high-throughput sequencing datasets in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive accessible with the keyword &quot;virome&quot;. In addition to the homology to bat coronaviruses observed in descriptions of the 2019-nCoV sequence (F. Wu et al. 2020, Nature, doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2008-3; P. Zhou et al. 2020, Nature, doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2012-7), we note a strong homology to numerous sequence reads in a metavirome dataset generated from the lungs of deceased Pangolins reported by Liu et al. (Viruses 11:11, 2019, http://doi.org/10.3390/v11110979). Our observations are relevant to discussions of the derivation of 2019-nCoV and illustrate the utility and limitations of meta-metagenomic search tools in effective and rapid characterization of potentially significant nucleic acid sequences.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Walls, Alexandra C</author><author>Park, Young-Jun</author><author>Tortorici, M Alejandra</author><author>Wall, Abigail</author><author>McGuire, Andrew T</author><author>Veesler, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Structure, Function, and Antigenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Glycoprotein.</title><secondary-title>Cell</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cell</publisher><accession-num>32155444</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cell.2020.02.058</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32155444</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;peer;reviewed</label><abstract>The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in &gt;90,000 infections and &gt;3,000 deaths.

Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in mainland China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. Methods: A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number Rc, as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), of the disease transmission in mainland China excluding Hubei province. Results: The estimation outcomes indicate that the control reproduction number is 3.36 (95% CI 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dropped below 1 since January 31st, 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in mainland China excluding Hubei province are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to the spread of disease for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even cause epidemic or outbreak again. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we proved that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020. Conclusions: To ensure the epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April. If all the above conditions are met, the outbreak is expected to be ended by April in mainland China apart from Hubei province. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.11971240 and No.11871093) and the NSF of the Jiangsu Higher Education Committee of China (No.17KJA110002) ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Methods: 123 NCP patients were divided into mild and severe groups. Peripheral blood was collected, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected. Correlation analysis was performed on the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, and the differences between the indexes of the two groups were analyzed. Results: 102 mild and 21 severe patients were included. Lymphocyte subsets were reduced in two groups. The proportion of CD8 + T reduction in the mild and severe group was 28.43% and 61.9%, respectively; The proportion of B cell reduction was 25.49% and 28.57%; The proportion of NK cell reduction was 34.31% and 47.62%; The detection value of IL-6 was 0 in 55.88% of the mild group, mild group has a significantly lower proportion of patients with IL-6 higher than normal than severe group; There was no significant linear correlation between the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines, while significant differences were noticed between the two groups in CD4 + T, CD8 + T, IL-6 and IL-10. Conclusions: Low levels of CD4+T and CD8+T are common in severe NCP. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were higher in severe patients. T cell subsets and cytokines can be used as one of the basis for predicting the transition from mild to severe. Large number of samples are still needed to confirm the &quot;warning value&quot; of CD4 + T, CD8 + T IL-6 and IL-10.

METHODS Individual-level data on 25,961 laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases reported through February 18, 2020 were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System. Based on key events and interventions, we divided the epidemic into four periods: before January 11, January 11-22, January 23 - February 1, and February 2-18. We compared epidemiological characteristics across periods and different demographic groups. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to study the epidemic and evaluate the impact of interventions. RESULTS The median age of the cases was 57 years and 50.3% were women. The attack rate peaked in the third period and substantially declined afterwards across geographic regions, sex and age groups, except for children (age &lt;20) whose attack rate continued to increase. Healthcare workers and elderly people had higher attack rates and severity risk increased with age. The effective reproductive number dropped from 3.86 (95% credible interval 3.74 to 3.97) before interventions to 0.32 (0.28 to 0.37) post interventions. The interventions were estimated to prevent 94.5% (93.7 to 95.2%) infections till February 18. We found that at least 59% of infected cases were unascertained in Wuhan, potentially including asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS Considerable countermeasures have effectively controlled the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Special efforts are needed to protect vulnerable populations, including healthcare workers, elderly and children. Estimation of unascertained cases has important implications on continuing surveillance and interventions.

Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. Methods: From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results: This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20–24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>wang, Danyu</author><author>Guo, Jing-Ming</author><author>Yang, Zhuang-Zhi</author><author>You, Yong</author><author>Chen, Zhi-Chao</author><author>Chen, Shi-Ming</author><author>Cheng, Hui</author><author>Zhang, You-Shan</author><author>Jiang, Dao-Zi</author><author>Zuo, Xue-Lan</author><author>Zhu, Xiao-Jian</author><author>Huang, Jun</author><author>Wang, Hong-Xiang</author><author>Li, Qing</author><author>Wu, Qing</author><author>Huang, Zhi-Ping</author><author>Liu, Qi-Huan</author><author>Bao, Ying</author><author>Zhang, Da-Lin</author><author>Zhang, Xin-Hua</author><author>Zhao, Zhe</author><author>Ge, Ren-Ying</author><author>Du, Jie</author><author>Wang, Ya-Ping</author><author>Ren, Hong-Bo</author><author>Han, Hong</author><author>Wei, Yun-Hui</author><author>Xiang, Hang</author><author>Wan, Chu-Cheng</author><author>Zhao, You-Fang</author><author>Chen, Bin</author><author>Yuan, Guo-Ling</author><author>Li, Meng</author><author>Li, Wei-ming</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recommendations for standardized management of CML patients in the core epidemic area of COVID-19 (Multi-center survey results in Hubei Province, China)</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.12.20034876</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.12.20034876</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>coronavirus;not added;reviewed</label><abstract>Background Since late December 2019, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, that began in Wuhan, has become endemic in China and more than 100 countries and regions in the world. There is no report about the prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients untill now. We aimed to describe the clinical course, outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 and prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients. Methods In this multi-center survey, cross-sectional survey, observational study, the clinical data of CML patients with COVID-19 in each center were collected. Simultaneously, an online survey was conducted for information about the CML patients under the management at each center by asking the CML patients to complete a questionnaire,from February 15, 2020 to February 21, 2020. The questionnaire includes demographic data, place of residence, smoking status, CML diagnosis and treatment, comorbidities, combined medications, epidemiological history, symptoms(fever, cough, shortness of breath, etc) during the epidemic. Additional clinical data was collected on respondents suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. We described and analyzed the prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, and focus on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Data were compared between the CML patients with optimal response and those with non-optimal response. The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 in CML patients, as of Feb 21, 2020. Secondary outcomes included the history of epidemiology of CML patients, the clinical characteristics and outcomes of CML patients with COVID-19 . Findings Of 392 respondents, 223( 56.9%) were males, and 240( 61.2%) were 50 years or younger. Only 10 patients took drugs irregularly due to the influence of the epidemic because of traffic control, pharmacies unable to operate normally, etc. In the history of epidemiology, there were 4 patients with definite contact with COVID-19, of which 3 were remote contact and 1 was close contact. 12 respondents had fever, cough or shortness of breath during the epidemic, 1 case (common type) was confirmed with COVID-19 and cured after treatment. 1 patient was clinically diagnosed and succumbed. 1 of 299 (0.3%) patients with an optimal response was diagnosed with COVID-19. Of the 50 patients who failed to respond to CML treatment or had a poor response, 1 patient (2%) had a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Interpretation While the 392 CML respondents required regular referrals to hospitals, they did not have much contact with COVID-19 patients during the outbreak. Patients who failed to achieved an optimal response to CML therapy appear more likely to have a symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. Older patients with comorbidities are at increased risk of death.

The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of affected patients is limited. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of NCIP. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective, single-center case series of the 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan, China, from January 1 to January 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 3, 2020. EXPOSURES: Documented NCIP. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of critically ill patients and noncritically ill patients were compared. Presumed hospital-related transmission was suspected if a cluster of health professionals or hospitalized patients in the same wards became infected and a possible source of infection could be tracked. RESULTS: Of 138 hospitalized patients with NCIP, the median age was 56 years (interquartile range, 42-68; range, 22-92 years) and 75 (54.3%) were men. Hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for affected health professionals (40 [29%]) and hospitalized patients (17 [12.3%]). Common symptoms included fever (136 [98.6%]), fatigue (96 [69.6%]), and dry cough (82 [59.4%]). Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 0.8 × 109/L [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.6-1.1]) occurred in 97 patients (70.3%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.0 seconds [IQR, 12.3-13.7]) in 80 patients (58%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (261 U/L [IQR, 182-403]) in 55 patients (39.9%). Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all patients. Most patients received antiviral therapy (oseltamivir, 124 [89.9%]), and many received antibacterial therapy (moxifloxacin, 89 [64.4%]; ceftriaxone, 34 [24.6%]; azithromycin, 25 [18.1%]) and glucocorticoid therapy (62 [44.9%]). Thirty-six patients (26.1%) were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (22 [61.1%]), arrhythmia (16 [44.4%]), and shock (11 [30.6%]). The median time from first symptom to dyspnea was 5.0 days, to hospital admission was 7.0 days, and to ARDS was 8.0 days. Patients treated in the ICU (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 years vs 51 years), were more likely to have underlying comorbidities (26 [72.2%] vs 38 [37.3%]), and were more likely to have dyspnea (23 [63.9%] vs 20 [19.6%]), and anorexia (24 [66.7%] vs 31 [30.4%]). Of the 36 cases in the ICU, 4 (11.1%) received high-flow oxygen therapy, 15 (41.7%) received noninvasive ventilation, and 17 (47.2%) received invasive ventilation (4 were switched to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). As of February 3, 47 patients (34.1%) were discharged and 6 died (overall mortality, 4.3%), but the remaining patients are still hospitalized. Among those discharged alive (n = 47), the median hospital stay was 10 days (IQR, 7.0-14.0). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with confirmed NCIP in Wuhan, China, presumed hospital-related transmission of 2019-nCoV was suspected in 41% of patients, 26% of patients received ICU care, and mortality was 4.3%.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Huiwen</author><author>Zhang, Yanwen</author><author>Lu, Shan</author><author>Wang, Shanshan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tracking and forecasting milepost moments of the epidemic in the early-outbreak: framework and applications to the COVID-19</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.21.20040139</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.21.20040139</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><abstract>Background. The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has attracted global attention. In the early stage of the outbreak, the most important question concerns some meaningful milepost moments, including (1) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases decreases, (2) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes smaller than that of the daily removed (recovered and death), (3) the time when the number of daily confirmed cases becomes zero, and (4) the time when the number of patients treated in hospital is zero, which indicates the end of the epidemic. Intuitively, the former two can be regarded as two important turning points which indicate the alleviation of epidemic to some extent, while the latter two as two \``zero&quot; points, respectively. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to make right and precise prediction due to the limited amount of available data at a early stage of the outbreak. Method. To address it, in this paper, we propose a flexible framework incorporating the effectiveness of the government control to forecast the whole process of a new unknown infectious disease in its early-outbreak. Specially, we first establish the iconic indicators to characterize the extent of epidemic spread, yielding four periods of the whole process corresponding to the four meaningful milepost moments: two turning points and two \``zero&quot; points. Then we develop the tracking and forecasting procedure with mild and reasonable assumption. Finally we apply it to analyze and evaluate the COVID-19 using the public available data for mainland China beyond Hubei Province from the China Centers for Disease Control (CDC) during the period of Jan 29th, 2020, to Feb 29th, 2020, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. Results. Results show that our model can clearly outline the development of the epidemic at a very early stage. The first prediction results on Jan 29th reveal that the first and second milepost moments for mainland China beyond Hubei Province would appear on Jan 31st and Feb 14th respectively, which are only one day and three days behind the real world situations. Forecasting results indicate that the number of newly confirmed cases will become zero in the mid-late March, and the number of patients treated in the hospital will become zero between mid-March and mid-April in mainland China beyond Hubei Province. The framework proposed in this paper can help people get a general understanding of the epidemic trends in counties where COVID-19 are raging as well as any other outbreaks of new and unknown infectious diseases in the future.

Since the outbreak, several groups reported estimated R0 of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and generated valuable prediction for the early phase of this outbreak. After implementation of strict prevention and control measures in China, new estimation is needed. An infectious disease dynamics SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Removed) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Wuhan, China under two assumptions of Rt. In the first assumption, Rt was assumed to maintain over 1. The estimated number of infections would continue to increase throughout February without any indication of dropping with Rt = 1.9, 2.6 or 3.1. The number of infections would reach 11,044, 70,258 and 227,989, respectively, by 29 February 2020. In the second assumption, Rt was assumed to gradually decrease at different phases from high level of transmission (Rt = 3.1, 2.6 and 1.9) to below 1 (Rt = 0.9 or 0.5) owing to increasingly implemented public heath intervention. Several phases were divided by the dates when various levels of prevention and control measures were taken in effect in Wuhan. The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection.

The estimated number of infections would reach the peak in late February, which is 58,077–84,520 or 55,869–81,393. Whether or not the peak of the number of infections would occur in February 2020 may be an important index for evaluating the sufficiency of the current measures taken in China. Regardless of the occurrence of the peak, the currently strict measures in Wuhan should be continuously implemented and necessary strict public health measures should be applied in other locations in China with high number of COVID-19 cases, in order to reduce Rt to an ideal level and control the infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Jiancong</author><author>Zhou, Mouqing</author><author>Liu, Fangfei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exploring the reasons for healthcare workers infected with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hospital Infection</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hospital Infection</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>J Hosp Infect</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhin.2020.03.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0195670120301018</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Jianhui</author><author>Qi, Hongbo</author><author>Bao, Lei</author><author>Li, Fang</author><author>Shi, Yuan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A contingency plan for the management of the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak in neonatal intensive care units</title><secondary-title>The Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S2352-4642(20)30040-7</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1016/S2352-4642</url><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352464220300407</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Jun</author><author>Zhao, Shanmeizi</author><author>Liu, Ming</author><author>Zhao, Zhiyao</author><author>Xu, Yiping</author><author>Wang, Ping</author><author>Lin, Meng</author><author>Xu, Yanhui</author><author>Huang, Bing</author><author>Zuo, Xiaoyu</author><author>Chen, Zhanghua</author><author>Bai, Fan</author><author>Cui, Jun</author><author>Lew, Andrew M</author><author>Zhao, Jincun</author><author>Zhang, Yan</author><author>Luo, Haibin</author><author>Zhang, Yuxia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>ACE2 expression by colonic epithelial cells is associated with viral infection, immunity and energy metabolism</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.05.20020545</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.05.20020545</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/02/07/2020.02.05.20020545.full.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Respiratory disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia first emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and spread rapidly to other provinces and other countries. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Paradoxically, ACE2 expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. In summary, we suggest that ACE2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-nCoV infection.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe National Natural Science Foundation of China (91742109, 31770978, 31722003, 31770925, 31370847, 81770552), National Key Research and Development Program (2016YFC0900102), National Science and Technology Major Project (2018ZX10302205), Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Research in Structural Birth Defect Disease (2019B030301004), Guangzhou Women and Children s Medical Center Fund (5001-3001032) and National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (1037321, 1105209, 1143976, and 1080321 to A.L.) funded this study.

Here, we reported a research finding that SARS-CoV-2 invaded host cells via a novel route of CD147-spike protein (SP). SP bound to CD147, a receptor on the host cells, thereby mediating the viral invasion. Our further research confirmed this finding. First, in vitro antiviral tests indicated Meplazumab, an anti-CD147 humanized antibody, significantly inhibited the viruses from invading host cells, with an EC50 of 24.86 μg/mL and IC50 of 15.16 μg/mL. Second, we validated the interaction between CD147 and SP, with an affinity constant of 1.85E-07M. Co-Immunoprecipitation and ELISA also confirmed the binding of the two proteins. Finally, the localization of CD147 and SP was observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells by immuno-electron microscope. Therefore, the discovery of the new route CD147-SP for SARS-CoV-2 invading host cells provides a critical target for development of specific antiviral drugs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Lunwen</author><author>Li, Xun</author><author>Chen, Hui</author><author>Yan, Shaonan</author><author>Li, Yan</author><author>Li, Dong</author><author>Gong, Zuojiong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SARS-CoV-2 infection does not significantly cause acute renal injury: an analysis of 116 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a single hospital, Wuhan, China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.19.20025288</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.19.20025288</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Summary Background Whether the patients with COVID-19 infected by SARS-CoV-2 would commonly develop acute renal function damage is a problem worthy of clinical attention. This study aimed to explore the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on renal function through analyzing the clinical data of 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients. Methods 116 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients enrolled in this study were hospitalized in the Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 14 to February 13, 2020. The recorded information includes demographic data, medical history, contact history, potential comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory test results, chest computer tomography (CT) scans, and treatment measures. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 53 urine sediments of enrolled patients was examined by real-time RT-PCR. Findings 12 (10.8%) and 8 (7.2%) patients showed mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen or creatinine, and trace or 1+ albuminuria respectively in 111 COVID-19-confirmed patients without basic kidney disease. In addition, 5 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) were undergone regular continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) were confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2, and diagnosed as COVID-19. Beside the treatment of COVID-19, CRRT was also applied three times weekly. The course of treatment, the renal function indicators showed stable, without exacerbation of CRF, and pulmonary inflammation was gradually absorbed. All 5 patients with CRF were survived. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine sediments was positive only in 3 patients from 48 cases without renal illness before, and one patient had a positive for SARS-CoV-2 ORF 1ab from 5 cases with CRF. Interpretation Acute renal impairment was uncommon in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection does not significantly cause obvious acute renal injury, or aggravate CRF in the COVID-19 patients.

Methods We collected the cumulative number of confirmed cases of all cities and regions affected by COVID-19 in the world from January 20 to February 4, 2020, and calculated the daily means of the average, minimum and maximum temperatures in January. Then, restricted cubic spline function and generalized linear mixture model were used to analyze the relationships. Results There were in total 24,232 confirmed cases in China and 26 overseas countries. In total, 16,480 cases (68.01%) were from Hubei Province. The lgN rose as the average temperature went up to a peak of 8.72℃ and then slowly declined. The apexes of the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature were 6.70℃ and 12.42℃ respectively. The curves shared similar shapes. Under the circumstance of lower temperature, every 1℃ increase in average, minimum and maximum temperatures led to an increase of the cumulative number of cases by 0.83, 0.82 and 0.83 respectively. In the single-factor model of the higher-temperature group, every 1℃ increase in the minimum temperature led to a decrease of the cumulative number of cases by 0.86. Conclusion The study found that, to certain extent, temperature could significant change COVID-19 transmission, and there might be a best temperature for the viral transmission, which may partly explain why it first broke out in Wuhan. It is suggested that countries and regions with a lower temperature in the world adopt the strictest control measures to prevent future reversal.

COVID-19 diagnosis relies upon nucleic acid detection; however, current recommended methods exhibit high false-negative rates, low sensitivity, and cannot identify other respiratory virus infections, thereby resulting patient misdiagnosis and impeding epidemic containment. Combining the advantages of target amplification and long-read, real-time nanopore sequencing, we developed nanopore target sequencing (NTS) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses simultaneously within 6-10 h. Parallel testing with approved qPCR kits of SARS-CoV-2 and NTS using 61 nucleic acid samples from suspected COVID-19 cases confirmed that NTS identified more infected patients as positive, and could also monitor for mutated nucleic acid sequence or other respiratory virus infection in the test sample. NTS is thus suitable for contemporary COVID-19 diagnosis; moreover, this platform can be further extended for diagnosing other viruses or pathogens.

Sample types, interpretation methods, and corresponding laboratory standards must be established. The possibility of other infections should be assessed to provide a basis for clinical classification, isolation, and treatment. Accordingly, in the present study, we evaluated the testing methods for 2019-nCoV and co-infections. Methods: We used a fluorescence-based quantitative PCR kit urgently distributed by the Chinese CDC to detect 8274 close contacts in the Wuhan region against two loci on the 2019-nCoV genome. We also analyzed 613 patients with fever who underwent multiple tests for 13 respiratory pathogens; 316 subjects were also tested for 2019-nCoV. Findings: Among the 8274 subjects, 2745 (33.2%) had 2019-nCoV infection; 5277 (63.8%) subjects showed negative results in the 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test (non-019-nCoV); and 252 cases (3.0%) because only one target was positive, the diagnosis was not definitive. Sixteen patients who originally had only one positive target were re-examined a few days later; 14 patients (87.5%) were finally defined as 2019-nCoV-positive, and 2 (12.5%) were finally defined as negative. The positive rates of nCoV-NP and nCovORF1ab were 34.7% and 34.7%, respectively. nCoV-NP-positive only and nCovORF1ab-positive cases accounted for 1.5% and 1.5%, respectively. In the 316 patients with multiple respiratory pathogens, 104 were positive for 2019-nCov and 6/104 had co-infection with coronavirus (3/104), influenza A virus (2/104), rhinovirus (2/104), and influenza A H3N2 (1/104); the remaining 212 patients had influenza A virus (11/202), influenza A H3N2 (11/202), rhinovirus (10/202), respiratory syncytial virus (7/202), influenza B virus (6/202), metapneumovirus (4/202), and coronavirus (2/202). Interpretation: Clinical testing methods for 2019-nCoV require improvement. Importantly, 5.8% of 2019-nCoV infected and 18.4% of non-2019-nCoV-infected patients had other pathogen infections. It is important to treat combined infections and perform rapid screening to avoid cross-contamination of patients. A test that quickly and simultaneously screens as many pathogens as possible is needed. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No founding ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Recent studies show that spike (S) proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may use the same host cell receptor called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entering into host cells. The affinity between ACE2 and 2019-nCoV S is much higher than ACE2 binding to SARS-CoV S protein, explaining that why 2019-nCoV seems to be more readily transmitted from the human to human. Here, we reported that ACE2 can be significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Basing on findings here, we propose that coronavirus infection can positively induce its cellular entry receptor to accelerate their replication and spread, thus drugs targeting ACE2 expression may be prepared for the future emerging infectious diseases caused by this cluster of viruses.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Pei</author><author>Lu, Junan</author><author>Jin, Yanyu</author><author>Zhu, Mengfan</author><author>Wang, Lingling</author><author>Chen, Shunjie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological characteristics of 1212 COVID-19 patients in Henan, China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.21.20026112</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.21.20026112</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Wang et al. - 2020 - Epidemiological characteristics of 1212 COVID-19 patients in Henan, China.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Based on publicly released data for 1212 patients, we investigated the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Henan of China.

To control the spread of the disease, screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment measures is a priority. Viral nucleic acid testing based on specimens from the lower respiratory tract is the diagnostic gold standard. However, the availability and quality of laboratory testing in the infected region presents a challenge, so alternative diagnostic methods are urgently needed to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographical changes in CT images, we hypothesized that Artificial Intelligence's deep learning methods might be able to extract COVID-19's specific graphical features and provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control. To test this possibility, we collected 453 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases along with previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia. 217 images were used as the training set and the inception migration-learning model was used to establish the algorithm. The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 82.9% with specificity of 80.5% and sensitivity of 84%. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 73.1% with specificity of 67% and sensitivity of 74%. These results indicate the great value of using the deep learning method to extract radiological graphical features for COVID-19 diagnosis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNo fundingAuthor DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

In a very short time, this virus spread rapidly over China, greatly threatening public health and economic development. The Chinese government acted quickly and implemented a series of strategies to prevent diffusion of this disease. We therefore sought to evaluate the effects of these Chinese strategies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. Methods: From the data of cumulative confirmed cases from provincial Health Commission websites of China, we performed model fitting and calculated the growth speed of cumulative confirmed patients. We further analyzed the time when this growth speed, the rate of the number of new cases, reached its maximum (Speedmax). Comparing different times to Speedmax of different areas in China, we calculated the dates at which the growth speed began to decline in different areas. Also, The number of plateaus were analyzed. Results: The quartic model showed the best fit. For almost all areas in mainland China, the speed of infections reached Speedmax and began to decline within 14 days; exceptions were Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Guizhou, and Hubei. The number of plateaus was significantly correlated with the emigration index. However, the distance from other areas to Hubei and the number of plateaus had little influence on when a province or area arrived at Speedmax. Once strict intervention strategies were implemented, diffusion and deterioration of COVID-19 were inhibited quickly and effectively over China. Conclusion: Our study suggests that Chinese strategies are highly effective on controlling the diffusion and deterioration of the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia. These strategies supply experience and guidelines for other countries to control the COVID-19 epidemic.

Crude case fatality ratio (CFR) with dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases does not represent the true CFR and might be off by orders of magnitude. We aim to provide a precise estimate of the CFR of COVID-19 using statistical models at the early stage of the epidemic. Methods: We extracted data from the daily released epidemic report published by the National Health Commission P. R. China from 20 Jan 2020, to 22 Feb 2020. Competing risk model was used to obtain the cumulative hazards for death, cure, and cure-death hazard ratio. Then the CFR was estimated based on the slope of the last piece in joinpoint regression model, which reflected the most recent trend of the epidemic. Results: As of 22 Feb 2020, totally 77,041 cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 in China. The CFR of COVID-19 were estimated to be 7.24% (95% CI: 6.61%-8.01%) in Hubei province, including Wuhan, the epicenter, and 1.00% (95% CI: 0.87%-1.18%) in other areas of China, respectively. We observed obvious decreasing trends of CFR for COVID-19, with three distinct turning points on January 30, February 6, and February 15 for Hubei province, and one turning point on February 8 for other areas, respectively. Conclusions: Based on analyses of public data, we found that the CFR in Hubei was much higher than that of other regions in China, over 7 times in all estimation. The CFR would follow a downwards trend based on our estimation from recently released data. Nevertheless, at early stage of outbreak, CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously because of limited data source on true onset and recovery time. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No funding was received for the research reported in the article. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Existing evidence have confirmed the human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV. We retrospectively collected infection data from 2 January to 22 January at six departments from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. In our study, we found N95 respirators, disinfection and hand washing can help to reduce the risk of 2019-nCoV infection in medical staffs. Our results call for re-emphasizing strict occupational protection code in battling this novel contagious disease. The risk of 2019-nCoV infection was higher in the open area than in the quarantined area. N95 may be more effective for 2019-nCoV infections.

The clinical characteristics of severe pneumonia caused by 2019-nCoV are still not clear. Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the severe pneumonia caused by the 2019-nCoV in Wuhan, China. Method: The study included patients hospitalized at the central hospital of Wuhan who had been diagnosed with a pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus. Clinical features, chronic co-morbidities, demographic data, laboratory examinations, and chest computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed through electronic medical records. SPSS was used for data analysis to explore the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the patients with the severe pneumonia. Results: A total of 110 patients diagnosed with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia were included in the study, including 38 with severe pneumonia and 72 with non-severe pneumonia. Statistical analysis showed that advanced age, an increase of D-dimer, and a decrease of lymphocytes were characteristics of the patients with severe pneumonia. Moreover, in the early stage of the disease, chest CT scans of patients with the severe pneumonia showed the illness can progress rapidly. Conclusions: Advanced age, lymphocyte decline, and D-dimer elevation are important characteristics of patients with severe pneumonia. Clinicians should focus on these characteristics to identify high-risk patients at an early stage. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement The research received no funding. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

We aimed to evaluate the definite efficacy and safety of corticosteroid in the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Forty-six hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia hospitalized at Wuhan Union Hospital from January 20 to February 25, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups based on whether they received corticosteroid treatment. The clinical symptoms and chest computed tomography(CT) results were compared. Results: A total of 26 patients received intravenous administration of methylprednisolone with a dosage of 1-2mg/kg/d for 5-7 days, while the remaining patients not. There was no significant difference in age, sex, comorbidities, clinical or laboratory parameters between the two groups on admission. The average number of days for body temperature back to the normal range was significantly shorter in patients with administration of methylprednisolone when compared to those without administration of methylprednisolone (2.06 ± 0.28 vs. 5.29 ± 0.70, P=0.010). The patients with administration of methylprednisolone had a faster improvement of SpO2, while patients without administration of methylprednisolone had a significantly longer interval of using supplemental oxygen therapy (8.2days[IQR 7.0-10.3] vs. 13.5days(IQR 10.3-16); P&lt;0.001). In terms of chest CT, the absorption degree of the focus was significantly better in patients with administration of methylprednisolone. Conclusion: Our data indicate that in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early, low-dose and short-term application of corticosteroid was associated with a faster improvement of clinical symptoms and absorption of lung focus.

Transmission on a regional and then national scale was promoted by intense travel during the holiday period of the Chinese New Year. We studied the variation in transmission of COVID-19, locally in Wuhan, as well as on a larger spatial scale, among different cities and even among provinces in mainland China. Methods In addition to reported numbers of new cases, we have been able to assemble detailed contact data for some of the initial clusters of COVID-19. This enabled estimation of the serial interval for clinical cases, as well as reproduction numbers for small and large regions. Findings We estimated the average serial interval was 4.8 days. For early transmission in Wuhan, any infectious case produced as many as four new cases, transmission outside Wuhan was less intense, with reproduction numbers below two. During the rapid growth phase of the outbreak the region of Wuhan city acted as a hot spot, generating new cases upon contact, while locally, in other provinces, transmission was low. Interpretation COVID-19 is capable of spreading very rapidly. The sizes of outbreak in provinces of mainland China mainly depended on the numbers of cases imported from Wuhan as the local reproduction numbers were low. The COVID-19 epidemic should be controllable with appropriate interventions. Funding No specific funding.

According to the latest clinical research, the respiratory pattern of COVID-19 is different from the respiratory patterns of flu and the common cold. One significant symptom that occurs in the COVID-19 is Tachypnea. People infected with COVID-19 have more rapid respiration. Our study can be utilized to distinguish various respiratory patterns and our device can be preliminarily put to practical use. Demo videos of this method working in situations of one subject and two subjects can be downloaded online. Research details: Accurate detection of the unexpected abnormal respiratory pattern of people in a remote and unobtrusive manner has great significance. In this work, we innovatively capitalize on depth camera and deep learning to achieve this goal. The challenges in this task are twofold: the amount of real-world data is not enough for training to get the deep model; and the intra-class variation of different types of respiratory patterns is large and the outer-class variation is small. In this paper, considering the characteristics of actual respiratory signals, a novel and efficient Respiratory Simulation Model (RSM) is first proposed to fill the gap between the large amount of training data and scarce real-world data. Subsequently, we first apply a GRU neural network with bidirectional and attentional mechanisms (BI-AT-GRU) to classify 6 clinically significant respiratory patterns (Eupnea, Tachypnea, Bradypnea, Biots, Cheyne-Stokes and Central-Apnea). The proposed deep model and the modeling ideas have the great potential to be extended to large scale applications such as public places, sleep scenario, and office environment.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Zeheng</author><author>Li, Liang</author><author>Yan, Jing</author><author>Yao, Yuanzhe</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Officially Recommended in China for COVID-19 Using Ontology-Based Side-Effect Prediction Framework (OSPF) and Deep Learning</title><secondary-title>arXiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>arXiv</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>COVID-19</keyword><keyword>artificial intelligence</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>side effect</keyword><keyword>tranditional Chinese medicine</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Preprints</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.20944/PREPRINTS202002.0230.V1</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202002.0230/v1</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Zhenwei</author><author>Chen, Xiaorong</author><author>Lu, Yunfei</author><author>Chen, Feifei</author><author>Zhang, Wei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical characteristics and therapeutic procedure for four cases with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia receiving combined Chinese and Western medicine treatment</title><secondary-title>BioScience Trends</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BioScience Trends</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5582/bst.2020.01030</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>www.biosciencetrends.com</url><url>https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bst/advpub/0/advpub_2020.01030/_article</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wassenaar, Trudy M.</author><author>Zou, Ying</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>2019_nCoV: Rapid classification of betacoronaviruses and identification of traditional Chinese medicine as potential origin of zoonotic coronaviruses</title><secondary-title>Letters in Applied Microbiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Letters in Applied Microbiology</full-title></periodical><pages>lam.13285</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Lett Appl Microbiol</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/lam.13285</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/lam.13285</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Watanabe, Yasunori</author><author>Berndsen, Zachary T.</author><author>Raghwani, Jayna</author><author>Seabright, Gemma E.</author><author>Allen, Joel D.</author><author>McLellan, Jason S</author><author>Wilson, Ian A.</author><author>Bowden, Thomas A.</author><author>Ward, Andrew B.</author><author>Crispin, Max</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vulnerabilities in coronavirus glycan shields despite extensive glycosylation</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.20.957472</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.20.957472</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses (CoVs) are zoonotic pathogens with high fatality rates and pandemic potential. Vaccine development has focussed on the principal target of the neutralizing humoral immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion. Coronavirus S proteins are extensively glycosylated viral fusion proteins, encoding around 69-87 N-linked glycosylation sites per trimeric spike. Using a multifaceted structural approach, we reveal a specific area of high glycan density on MERS S that results in the formation of under-processed oligomannose-type glycan clusters, which was absent on SARS and HKU1 CoVs. We provide a comparison of the global glycan density of coronavirus spikes with other viral proteins including HIV-1 envelope, Lassa virus glycoprotein complex, and influenza hemagglutinin, where glycosylation plays a known role in shielding immunogenic epitopes. Consistent with the ability of the antibody-mediated immune response to effectively target and neutralize coronaviruses, we demonstrate that the glycans of coronavirus spikes are not able to form an efficacious high-density global shield to thwart the humoral immune response. Overall, our data reveal how differential organisation of viral glycosylation across class I viral fusion proteins influence not only individual glycan compositions but also the immunological pressure across the viral protein surface.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weber, Albertine</author><author>Ianelli, Flavio</author><author>Goncalves, Sebastian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Trend analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in China and the rest of the world</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09032</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The recent epidemic of Coronavirus (COVID-19) that started in China has already been &quot;exported&quot; to more than 140 countries in all the continents, evolving in most of them by local spreading. In this contribution we analyze the trends of the cases reported in all the Chinese provinces, as well as in some countries that, until March 15th, 2020, have more than 500 cases reported. Notably and differently from other epidemics, the provinces did not show an exponential phase. The data available at the Johns Hopkins University site seem to fit well an algebraic sub-exponential growing behavior as was pointed out recently. All the provinces show a clear and consistent pattern of slowing down with growing exponent going nearly zero, so it can be said that the epidemic was contained in China. On the other side, the more recent spread in countries like, Italy, Iran, and Spain show a clear exponential growth, as well as other European countries. Even more recently, US -which was one of the first countries to have an individual infected outside China (Jan 21st, 2020)- seems to follow the same path. We calculate the exponential growth of the most affected countries, showing the evolution along time after the first local case. We identify clearly different patterns in the analyzed data and we give interpretations and possible explanations for them. The analysis and conclusions of our study can help countries that, after importing some cases, are not yet in the local spreading phase, or have just started.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wei, Jiangping</author><author>Xu, Huaxiang</author><author>Xiong, Jingliang</author><author>Shen, Qinglin</author><author>Fan, Bing</author><author>Ye, Chenglong</author><author>Dong, Wentao</author><author>Hu, Fangfang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia: Serial Computer Tomography Findings</title><secondary-title>Korean Journal of Radiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Korean Journal of Radiology</full-title></periodical><volume>21</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Korean J Radiol</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.3348/kjr.2020.0112</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.kjronline.org/DOIx.php?id=10.3348/kjr.2020.0112</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wei, Qiang</author><author>Wang, Yanhai</author><author>Ma, Juncai</author><author>Han, Jun</author><author>Jiang, Mengnan</author><author>Zhao, Li</author><author>Ye, Fei</author><author>Song, Jingdong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Notes from the Field Description of the First Strain of 2019-nCoV , C-Tan-nCoV Wuhan Strain — National Pathogen Resource Center , China , 2020</title><secondary-title>China CDC Weekly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>China CDC Weekly</full-title></periodical><pages>81-82</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Description+of+the+First+Strain+of+2019-nCoV,+C-Tan-nCoV+Wuhan+Strain+—+National+Pathogen+Resource+Center,+China,+2020.pdf</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e3a460f1-661b-4180-b562-ecd8e9502082</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wells, Chad R.</author><author>Sah, Pratha</author><author>Moghadas, Seyed M.</author><author>Pandey, Abhishek</author><author>Shoukat, Affan</author><author>Wang, Yaning</author><author>Wang, Zheng</author><author>Meyers, Lauren A.</author><author>Singer, Burton H.</author><author>Galvani, Alison P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impact of international travel and border control measures on the global spread of the novel 2019 coronavirus outbreak</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>202002616</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1073/pnas.2002616117</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2002616117</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The novel coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) in mainland China has rapidly spread across the globe. Within 2 mo since the outbreak was first reported on December 31, 2019, a total of 566 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS CoV-2) cases have been confirmed in 26 other countries. Travel restrictions and border control measures have been enforced in China and other countries to limit the spread of the outbreak. We estimate the impact of these control measures and investigate the role of the airport travel network on the global spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results show that the daily risk of exporting at least a single SARS CoV-2 case from mainland China via international travel exceeded 95% on January 13, 2020. We found that 779 cases (95% CI: 632 to 967) would have been exported by February 15, 2020 without any border or travel restrictions and that the travel lockdowns enforced by the Chinese government averted 70.5% (95% CI: 68.8 to 72.0%) of these cases. In addition, during the first three and a half weeks of implementation, the travel restrictions decreased the daily rate of exportation by 81.3% (95% CI: 80.5 to 82.1%), on average. At this early stage of the epidemic, reduction in the rate of exportation could delay the importation of cases into cities unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak, buying time to coordinate an appropriate public health response.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wells, Stephen Anthony</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rigidity, normal modes and flexible motion of a SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) protease structure.</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.10.986190</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.10.986190</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The rigidity and flexibility of two recently reported crystal structures (PDB entries 6Y2E and 6LU7) of a protease from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the infectious agent of the COVID-19 respiratory disease, has been investigated using pebble-game rigidity analysis, elastic network model normal mode analysis, and all-atom geometric simulations. This computational investigation of the viral protease follows protocols that have been effective in studying other homodimeric enzymes. The protease is predicted to display flexible motions in vivo which directly affect the geometry of a known inhibitor binding site and which open new potential binding sites elsewhere in the structure. A database of generated PDB files representing natural flexible variations on the crystal structures has been produced and made available for download from an institutional data archive.

While the newly defined subgenera provide much-needed standardisation for commonly cited viruses of public health importance, no method has been proposed for the assignment of subgenus based on partial sequence data, or for sequences that are divergent from the designated holotype reference genomes. Here, we describe the genetic variation of a partial region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on designated holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly. We thus propose that partial RdRp sequence data of coronaviruses is sufficient for the attribution of subgenus-level taxonomic classifications and we supply the R package, “MyCoV”, which provides a method for attributing subgenus and assessing the reliability of the attribution.

Importance Statement The analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons derived from biological samples is the most common modern method for detection and classification of infecting viral agents, such as Coronaviruses. Recent updates to the official standard for taxonomic classification of Coronaviruses, however, may leave researchers unsure as to whether the viral sequences they obtain by these methods can be classified into specific viral taxa due to variations in the sequences when compared to type strains. Here, we present a plausible method for defining genetic dissimilarity cut-offs that will allow researchers to state which taxon their virus belongs to and with what level of certainty. To assist in this, we also provide the R package ‘MyCoV’ which classifies user generated sequences.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Willem, Lander</author><author>Hoang, Thang Va</author><author>Funk, Sebastian</author><author>Coletti, Pietro</author><author>Beutels, Philippe</author><author>Hens, Niel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SOCRATES: An online tool leveraging a social contact data sharing initiative to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.03.20030627</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.03.20030627</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Objective: Establishing a social contact data sharing initiative and an online tool to assess mitigation strategies for COVID-19.

However, cases seen outside the epicenter of the epidemic may differ in their overall clinical appearance due to more sensitive case finding. Methods: We studied viral load courses by RT-PCR in oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, stool, blood, and urine in nine hospitalized cases. Infectious virus was detected by cell culture. Active replication was demonstrated by analysis of viral subgenomic replicative intermediates. Serology including neutralization testing was done to characterize immune response. Results: Seven cases had upper respiratory tract disease. Lower respiratory tract symptoms seen in two cases were limited. Clinical sensitivity of RT-PCR on swabs taken on days 1-5 of symptoms was 100%, with no differences comparing swab and sputum samples taken simultaneously. Average viral load was 6.76x10E5 copies per swab during the first 5 days. Live virus isolates were obtained from swabs during the first week of illness. Proof of active viral replication in upper respiratory tract tissues was obtained by detection of subgenomic viral RNA. Shedding of viral RNA from sputum outlasted the end of symptoms. Seroconversion occurred after about one week. Conclusions: The present study shows that COVID-19 can often present as a common cold-like illness. SARS-CoV-2 can actively replicate in the upper respiratory tract, and is shed for a prolonged time after symptoms end, including in stool. These findings suggest adjustments of current case definitions and re-evaluation of the prospects of outbreak containment.

The exponential increase of the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. Findings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the local government. A high uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found, particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. The majority of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-CoV. Few of the participants from Wuhan (16.6%, n = 475) and those participants who were under quarantine (13.8%, n = 550) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment. Similarly, being under quarantine (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant determinants of hospital treatment-seeking. Interpretation The results of this study suggest that institutional trust is an important factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking formal medical care during an outbreak. In view of the 2019-nCoV being highly pathogenic and extremely contagious, our findings also underscore the importance of public health intervention to reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant to seek treatment at formal health services.

Genomic analyses of nCoV-2019 determined a 96% resemblance with a coronavirus isolated from a bat in 2013 (RaTG13); however, the receptor binding motif (RBM) of these two genomes share low sequence similarity. This divergence suggests a possible alternative source for the RBM coding sequence in nCoV-2019. We identified high sequence similarity in the RBM between nCoV-2019 and a coronavirus genome reconstructed from a viral metagenomic dataset from pangolins possibly indicating a more complex origin for nCoV-2019.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Woo, Chang Ha</author><author>Jang, Sungho</author><author>Shin, Giyoung</author><author>Jung, Gyoo Yeol</author><author>Lee, Jeong Wook</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sensitive one-step isothermal detection of pathogen-derived RNAs</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.05.20031971</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.05.20031971</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Woo et al. - 2020 - Sensitive one-step isothermal detection of pathogen-derived RNAs.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>The recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) require fast, simple, and sensitive onsite nucleic acid diagnostics that can be developed rapidly to prevent the spread of diseases. We have developed a SENsitive Splint-based one-step isothermal RNA detection (SENSR) method for rapid and straightforward onsite detection of pathogen RNAs with high sensitivity and specificity. SENSR consists of two simple enzymatic reactions: a ligation reaction by SplintR ligase and subsequent transcription by T7 RNA polymerase. The resulting transcript forms an RNA aptamer that induces fluorescence. Here, we demonstrate that SENSR is an effective and highly sensitive method for the detection of the current epidemic pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We also show that the platform can be extended to the detection of five other pathogens. Overall, SENSR is a molecular diagnostic method that can be developed rapidly for onsite uses requiring high sensitivity, specificity, and short assaying times. ### Competing Interest Statement C.H.W., S.J., G.S., G.Y.J., &amp; J.W.L. have submitted a provisional patent application (No. 10-2019-0046713) relating to the one-step isothermal RNA detection. ### Funding Statement This research was supported by C1 Gas Refinery Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT (NRF-2015M3D3A1A01064926).

The CoV spike (S) glycoprotein is a key target for urgently needed vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics. To facilitate medical countermeasure (MCM) development we determined a 3.5 Å-resolution cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV S trimer in the prefusion conformation. The predominant state of the trimer has one of the three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) rotated up in a receptor-accessible conformation. We also show biophysical and structural evidence that the 2019-nCoV S binds ACE2 with higher affinity than SARS-CoV S. Additionally we tested several published SARS-CoV RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies and found that they do not have appreciable binding to nCoV-2019 S, suggesting antibody cross-reactivity may be limited between the two virus RBDs. The cryo-EM structure of 2019-nCoV S should enable rapid development and evaluation of MCMs to address the ongoing public health crisis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Aiping</author><author>Niu, Peihua</author><author>Wang, Lulan</author><author>Zhou, Hangyu</author><author>Zhao, Xiang</author><author>Wang, Wenling</author><author>Wang, Jingfeng</author><author>Ji, Chengyang</author><author>Ding, Xiao</author><author>Wang, Xianyue</author><author>Lu, Roujian</author><author>Gold, Sarah</author><author>Aliyari, Saba</author><author>Zhang, Shilei</author><author>Vikram, Ellee</author><author>Zou, Angela</author><author>Lenh, Emily</author><author>Chen, Janet</author><author>Ye, Fei</author><author>Han, Na</author><author>Peng, Yousong</author><author>Guo, Haitao</author><author>Wu, Guizhen</author><author>Jiang, Taijiao</author><author>Tan, Wenjie</author><author>Cheng, Genhong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mutations, Recombination and Insertion in the Evolution of 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.29.971101</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.29.971101</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) has spread more rapidly than any other betacoronavirus including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, the mechanisms responsible for infection and molecular evolution of this virus remained unclear. Methods: We collected and analyzed 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV including 11 novel genomes from patients in China. Through comprehensive analysis of the available genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains, we have tracked multiple inheritable SNPs and determined the evolution of 2019-nCoV relative to other coronaviruses. Results: Systematic analysis of 120 genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV revealed co-circulation of two genetic subgroups with distinct SNPs markers, which can be used to trace the 2019-nCoV spreading pathways to different regions and countries. Although 2019-nCoV, human and bat SARS-CoV share high homologous in overall genome structures, they evolved into two distinct groups with different receptor entry specificities through potential recombination in the receptor binding regions. In addition, 2019-nCoV has a unique four amino acid insertion between S1 and S2 domains of the spike protein, which created a potential furin or TMPRSS2 cleavage site. Conclusions: Our studies provided comprehensive insights into the evolution and spread of the 2019-nCoV. Our results provided evidence suggesting that 2019-nCoV may increase its infectivity through the receptor binding domain recombination and a cleavage site insertion.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Aiping</author><author>Peng, Yousong</author><author>Huang, Baoying</author><author>Ding, Xiao</author><author>Wang, Xianyue</author><author>Niu, Peihua</author><author>Meng, Jing</author><author>Zhu, Zhaozhong</author><author>Zhang, Zheng</author><author>Wang, Jiangyuan</author><author>Sheng, Jie</author><author>Quan, Lijun</author><author>Xia, Zanxian</author><author>Tan, Wenjie</author><author>Cheng, Genhong</author><author>Jiang, Taijiao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genome Composition and Divergence of the Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Originating in China</title><secondary-title>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.chom.2020.02.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S193131282030072X</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Chao</author><author>Zheng, Shufa</author><author>Chen, Yu</author><author>Zheng, Min</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Single-cell RNA expression profiling of ACE2, the putative receptor of Wuhan 2019-nCoV, in the nasal tissue</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.11.20022228</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.11.20022228</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Wu et al. - 2020 - Single-cell RNA expression profiling of ACE2, the putative receptor of Wuhan 2019-nCoV, in the nasal tissue.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, and then spreads to the other Provinces of China. WHO decides to determine a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of 2019-nCoV. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the tissues at different locations of the respiratory tract. The result indicates that the ACE2 expression appears in nasal epithelial cells. We found that the size of this population of ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells is comparable with the size of the population of ACE2-expression type II alveolar cells (AT2) in the Asian sample reported by Yu Zhao et al. We further detected 2019-nCoV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the nasal-swab and throat-swab of seven suspected cases. We found that 2019-nCoV tends to have a higher concentration in the nasal-swab comparing to the throat-swab, which could attribute to the ACE2-expressing nasal epithelial cells. We hope this study could be informative for virus-prevention strategy development, especially the treatment of nasal mucus. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work was supported by the grants from the National Key Programs for Infectious Diseases of China (2017ZX10103008). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Risk factors for the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia have not yet been well delineated. Objective To describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or died. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort study of 201 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in China between December 25, 2019, and January 26, 2020. The final date of follow-up was February 13, 2020. Exposures Confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Main Outcomes and Measures The development of ARDS and death. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and analyzed. Results Of 201 patients, the median age was 51 years (interquartile range, 43-60 years), and 128 (63.7%) patients were men. Eighty-four patients (41.8%) developed ARDS, and of those 84 patients, 44 (52.4%) died. In those who developed ARDS, compared with those who did not, more patients presented with dyspnea (50 of 84 [59.5%] patients and 30 of 117 [25.6%] patients, respectively [difference, 33.9%; 95% CI, 19.7%-48.1%]) and had comorbidities such as hypertension (23 of 84 [27.4%] patients and 16 of 117 [13.7%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-26.1%]) and diabetes (16 of 84 [19.0%] patients and 6 of 117 [5.1%] patients, respectively [difference, 13.9%; 95% CI, 3.6%-24.2%]). In bivariate Cox regression analysis, risk factors associated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death included older age (hazard ratio [HR], 3.26; 95% CI 2.08-5.11; and HR, 6.17; 95% CI, 3.26-11.67, respectively), neutrophilia (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.19; and HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17, respectively), and organ and coagulation dysfunction (eg, higher lactate dehydrogenase [HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.44-1.79; and HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.52, respectively] and D-dimer [HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04; and HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.04, respectively]). High fever (≥39 °C) was associated with higher likelihood of ARDS development (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.11-2.84) and lower likelihood of death (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.21-0.82). Among patients with ARDS, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.20-0.72). Conclusions and Relevance Older age was associated with greater risk of development of ARDS and death likely owing to less rigorous immune response. Although high fever was associated with the development of ARDS, it was also associated with better outcomes among patients with ARDS. Moreover, treatment with methylprednisolone may be beneficial for patients who develop ARDS.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Chaomin</author><author>Hu, Xianglin</author><author>Song, Jianxin</author><author>Du, Chunling</author><author>Xu, Jie</author><author>Yang, Dong</author><author>Chen, Dechang</author><author>Zhong, Ming</author><author>Jiang, Jinjun</author><author>Xiong, Weining</author><author>Lang, Ke</author><author>Zhang, Yuye</author><author>Shi, Guohua</author><author>Xu, Lei</author><author>Song, Yuanlin</author><author>Zhou, Xin</author><author>Wei, Ming</author><author>Zheng, Junhua</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Heart injury signs are associated with higher and earlier mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.26.20028589</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.26.20028589</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Importance: Heart injury can be easily induced by viral infection such as adenovirus and enterovirus. However, whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes heart injury and hereby impacts mortality has not yet been fully evaluated. Objective: To explore whether heart injury occurs in COVID-19 on admission and hereby aggravates mortality later. Design, Setting, and Participants A single-center retrospective cohort study including 188 COVID-19 patients admitted from December 25, 2019 to January 27, 2020 in Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, China; follow up was completed on February 11, 2020. Exposures: High levels of heart injury indicators on admission (hs-TNI; CK; CK-MB; LDH; α-HBDH). Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality in hospital and days from admission to mortality (survival days). Results: Of 188 patients with COVID-19, the mean age was 51.9 years (standard deviation: 14.26; range: 21~83 years) and 119 (63.3%) were male. Increased hs-TnI levels on admission tended to occur in older patients and patients with comorbidity (especially hypertension). High hs-TnI on admission (≥ 6.126 pg/mL), even within the clinical normal range (0~28 pg/mL), already can be associated with higher mortality. High hs-TnI was associated with increased inflammatory levels (neutrophils, IL-6, CRP, and PCT) and decreased immune levels (lymphocytes, monocytes, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). CK was not associated with mortality. Increased CK-MB levels tended to occur in male patients and patients with current smoking. High CK-MB on admission was associated with higher mortality. High CK-MB was associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased lymphocytes. Increased LDH and α-HBDH levels tended to occur in older patients and patients with hypertension. Both high LDH and α-HBDH on admission were associated with higher mortality. Both high LDH and α-HBDH were associated with increased inflammatory levels and decreased immune levels. hs-TNI level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.42, 95% CI= -0.64~-0.12, P=0.005). LDH level on admission was negatively correlated with survival days (r= -0.35, 95% CI= -0.59~-0.05, P=0.022). Conclusions and Relevance: Heart injury signs arise in COVID-19, especially in older patients, patients with hypertension and male patients with current smoking. COVID-19 virus might attack heart via inducing inflammatory storm. High levels of heart injury indicators on admission are associated with higher mortality and shorter survival days. COVID-19 patients with signs of heart injury on admission must be early identified and carefully managed by cardiologists, because COVID-19 is never just confined to respiratory injury.

We have summarized in detail the management strategies implemented by the Chinese governments during the outbreaks. By considering three scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-December 2019 to late-April 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. Our findings showed that if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred only in Wuhan city or Hubei province, facemask shortage would not appear with the existing public health measures. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health measures. Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers and the general population if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan city or Hubei province. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, facemask supplies in China could last for 5 days if under the existing public health measures and a shortage of 853 million facemasks is expected by 30 Apr 2020. Assuming a gradually decreased import volume, we estimated that dramatic increase in productivity (42.7 times of the usual level) is needed to mitigate the facemask crisis by the end of April. In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a shortage of facemasks and other medical resources can considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources. Global collaboration should be strengthened to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic via easing the medical resources crisis in the affected countries. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No external funding ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. METHODS We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23-24, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI). FINDINGS In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2·68 (95% CrI 2·47-2·86) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304-130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6·4 days (95% CrI 5·8-7·1). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227-805), 113 (57-193), 98 (49-168), 111 (56-191), and 80 (40-139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1-2 weeks. INTERPRETATION Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.

We use phenomenological models to dissect the development of the epidemics in China and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province. We use the experience from China to analyze the calibration results on Japan, South Korea, Iran, Italy and Europe, and make future scenario projections. Methods: we calibrate the logistic growth model, the generalized logistic growth model, the generalized growth model and the generalized Richards model to the reported number of infected cases from Jan. 19 to March 10 for the whole of China, 29 provinces in China, four severely affected countries and Europe as a whole. The different models provide upper and lower bounds of our scenario predictions. Results: We quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in China with a detailed analysis on the heterogenous situations across provinces. Based on Chinese experience, we identify a high risk in Japan with estimated total confirmed cases as of March 25 being 1574 (95% CI: [880, 2372]), and 5669 (95% CI: [988, 11340]) by June. For South Korea, we expect the number of infected cases to approach the ceiling, 7928 (95% CI: [6341, 9754]), in 20 days. We estimate 0.15% (95% CI: [0.03%, 0.30%]) of Italian population to be infected in a positive scenario. We would expect 114867 people infected in Europe in 10 days, in a negative but probable scenario, corresponding to 0.015% European population. Conclusions: The extreme containment measures implemented by China were very effective with some instructive variations across provinces. For other countries, it is almost inevitable to see the continuation of the outbreak in the coming months. Japan and Italy are in serious situations with no short-term end to the outbreak to be expected. There is a significant risk concerning the upcoming July 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Iran's situation is highly uncertain with unclear and negative future scenarios, while South Korea is approaching the end of the outbreak. Both Europe and the USA are at early stages of the outbreak, posing significant health and economic risks to the world in absence of serious measures.

The continuous rising of infected cases has imposed overwhelming pressure on public health decision and medical resource allocation in China. We managed to forecast the infection peak time in Hubei province and the severe and critical case distribution. Methods: We used data resource according to cases reported by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Jan 25, 2019, to Feb 28, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the peak infection time and the number of severe and critical cases in Wuhan on subsequent days. Medical observation, discharge, infected, non-Severe, infected and severe, cure and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, we will be able predict when the inflection peak time (the maximum open infection cases) in Hubei Province will occur. Also, we can use this model to predict the patient distribution (severe, non-severe) to better allocate medical resource. Under relative pessimistic scenario, the inflection peak time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. Results: In very optimistic scenarios (daily NCC decay rate of -10%), the peak time of open inflection cases will arrive around February 23-February 26. At the same time, there will be a peak in the numbers of severely ill and critically ill patients, between 6800-7200 and 1800-2000, respectively. In a relative optimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -5%), the inflection case peak time will arrive around February 28-March 2. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 7100-7800 and 1900-2200, respectively. In a relatively pessimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -1%), the inflection peak time does not arrive around the end of March. Estimated time is April 6-April 14. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively. We are using the diagnosis rate, mortality rate, cure rate as the 2/8 data. There should be room for improvement, if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the peak time will arrive earlier than our estimation. Also, the severe and critical case ratios are likely to decline as the virus becomes less toxic and medical conditions improve. If that happens, the peak numbers will be lower than predicted above. Conclusion: We can infer that we are still not close to the end of this outbreak and the number of critically ill patients is still climbing. Assisting critical care resources in Hubei province requires the government to consider further tilt, and it is vital to make reasonable management of doctors and medical assistance systems to curb the transmission trend.

It severely threats people's health of thousands in Chin and even other countries. In order to prevent its wide spread, it is necessary to understand the development of the epidemic with precise mathematical language. METHODS The various data of novel coronavirus pneumonia were collected from the official websites of the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China. According to epidemic and administrative division, three groups were divided to analyze the data, Hubei Province (including Wuhan), nationwide without Hubei and Henan Province. With classic SIR models, the fitting epidemiological curves of incidence have made, and basic reproduction number (R0) was also calculated as well. Therefore the disease's infection intensity, peak time and the epidemiological end time can be deduced. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement Funding:This study was supported by Scientific and Technical Project of Henan Science and Technology Department (192102310134), Open Project of National Health Commission Key Laboratory of Birth Defect Prevention (ZD201903) and Medical Foundation of Health and Family Planning Commission of Henan Province (No. 2018020589) ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

In this retrospective study, we attempt to summarize and analyze the chest CT features of 2019-nCov infections, and to identify the typical features to improved the diagnostic accuracy of new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP). Methods:Chest CT scans and Clinical data of 21 patients confirmed NCP in our hospital were enrolled.These patients were divided into mild and sever group according to clinical manifestations described by the 6th clinical practice guideline of NCP in China. Main clinical and chest CT features were analyzed and identify. Results: Fever (85.7%) and cough (80.9%) were the two main symptoms of NCP patients.More significantly higher incidence (85.7%) of shortness of breath in the severe cases. Multiple lesions in both lungs and with incidence of GGO(100%),vascular enlargement (76.5%) and cobblestone/reticular pattern(70.6%) were the major feature.The incidence of consolidation, mixed pattern and vascular enlargement features were up to 100% in the severe group, significantly higher than that of patients in mild group. In addition, the incidence of air-bronchogram, dilated bronchi with thickened wall and fibrosis in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the mild group. Conclusions: Fever and cough are the typical clinical features of NCP patients, and chest CT mainly manifested as multiple lesions in both lungs, often accompanied by GGO, vascular enlargement and cobblestone/reticular pattern.Changes in these main CT features can indicate development of the disease.

Previous studies describing clinical characteristics of the disease contained small cohorts from individual centers or larger series consisting of mixed cases from different hospitals. We report analyses of mortality and disease severity among 402 patients from a single hospital. The cohort included 297 patients with confirmed and 105 with suspected diagnosis. The latter group met the criteria for clinical diagnosis but nucleic acid tests results were initially interpreted as suspicious. Data were compared between genders and among different age groups. The overall case fatality is 5.2%. However, patients 70 years of age or older suffered a significantly higher mortality (17.8%), associated with more patients having severe or critical illness (57.5%). Patients 50 years of age or older had a mortality of 8.0%, and those younger than 50 years, 1.2%. Male patients had a mortality of 7.6% versus 2.9% in females.

Yet, the molecular basis that underlies their phenotypic convergence remains unknown. Here, we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological approach to examine the molecular basis leading to their phenotypic convergence. Our genome-level analyses show that the spike protein, which is responsible for receptor binding, has undergone significant Darwinian selection along the branches related to 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. Further examination shows an unusually high proportion of evolutionary convergent amino acid sites in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV clades, leading to the phylogenetic uniting of their RBD protein sequences. In addition to the spike protein, we also find the evolutionary convergence of its partner protein, ORF3a, suggesting their possible co-evolutionary convergence. Our results demonstrate a strong adaptive evolutionary convergence between COVID-19 and SARS-related CoV, possibly facilitating their adaptation to similar or identical receptors. Finally, it should be noted that many observed bat SARS-like CoVs that have an evolutionary convergent RBD sequence with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV may be pre-adapted to human host receptor ACE2, and hence would be potential new coronavirus sources to infect humans in the future.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Zunyou</author><author>McGoogan, Jennifer M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characteristics of and Important Lessons From the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in China</title><secondary-title>JAMA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>centers for disease control and prevention (u.s.)</keyword><keyword>china</keyword><keyword>covid-19</keyword><keyword>disease outbreaks</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1001/jama.2020.2648</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xi, Jin</author><author>Xu, Kangli</author><author>Jiang, Penglei</author><author>Lian, Jiangshan</author><author>Hao, Shaorui</author><author>Jia, Hongyu</author><author>Yao, Hangping</author><author>Zhang, Yimin</author><author>Zheng, Ruoheng</author><author>Chen, Dong</author><author>Yao, Jinmei</author><author>Hu, Jianhua</author><author>Gao, Jianguo</author><author>Shen, Jian</author><author>Wen, Liang</author><author>Ren, Yue</author><author>Yu, Guodong</author><author>Wang, Xiaoyan</author><author>Lu, Yingfeng</author><author>Yu, Xiaopeng</author><author>Yu, Liang</author><author>Xiang, Dairong</author><author>Zheng, Lin</author><author>Wu, Nanping</author><author>Lu, Xiangyun</author><author>Cheng, Linfang</author><author>Liu, Fumin</author><author>Wu, Haibo</author><author>Jin, Changzhong</author><author>Yang, Xiaofeng</author><author>Qian, Pengxu</author><author>Qiu, Yunqing</author><author>Sheng, Jifang</author><author>Liang, Tingbo</author><author>Li, Lanjuan</author><author>Yang, Yida</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Virus strain of a mild COVID-19 patient in Hangzhou representing a new trend in SARS-CoV-2 evolution related to Furin cleavage site</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.10.20033944</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.10.20033944</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>We found, in our 788 confirmed COVID-19 patients, the decreased rate of severe/critical type, increased liver/kidney damage and prolonged period of nuclear acid positivity during virus dissemination, when compared with Wuhan. To investigate the underlining mechanism, we isolated one strain of SARS- CoV-2 (ZJ01) in mild COVID-19 patient and found the existence of 35 specific gene mutation by gene alignment. Further phylogenetic analysis and RSCU heat map results suggested that ZJ01 may be a potential evolutionary branch of SARS-CoV-2. We classified 54 strains of viruses worldwide (C/T type) based on the base (C or T) at positions 8824 and 28247. ZJ01 were both T at these two sites, becoming the only TT type currently identified in the world. The prediction of Furin cleavage site (FCS) and the sequence alignment of virus family indicated that FCS may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. ZJ01 had mutations near FCS (F1-2), which caused changes in the structure and the electrostatic distribution of the S protein surface, further affecting the binding capacity of Furin. Single cell sequencing and ACE2-Furin co-expression results confirmed that Furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidney and colon while FCS may help SARS-CoV-2 infect these organs. The evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2 towards FCS formation may result in its clinical symptom becoming closer to HKU-1 and OC43 (the source of FCS sequence-PRRA) caused influenza, further showing potential in differentiating into mild COVID-19 subtypes.

To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be confirmed. Therefore, we herein used a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed plasma membrane fusion capacity superior to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We then generated a series of lipopeptides and found that the EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than that of EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, potently inhibiting replication of 4 live human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and emerging SARSr-CoVs.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xia, Wei</author><author>Liao, Jiaqiang</author><author>Li, Chunhui</author><author>Li, Yuanyuan</author><author>Qian, Xi</author><author>Sun, Xiaojie</author><author>Xu, Hongbo</author><author>Mahai, Gaga</author><author>Zhao, Xin</author><author>Shi, Lisha</author><author>Liu, Juan</author><author>Yu, Ling</author><author>Wang, Meng</author><author>Wang, Qianqian</author><author>Namat, Asmagvl</author><author>Li, Ying</author><author>Qu, Jingyu</author><author>Liu, Qi</author><author>Lin, Xiaofang</author><author>Cao, Shuting</author><author>Huan, Shu</author><author>Xiao, Jiying</author><author>Ruan, Fengyu</author><author>Wang, Hanjin</author><author>Xu, Qing</author><author>Ding, Xingjuan</author><author>Fang, Xingjie</author><author>Qiu, Feng</author><author>Ma, Jiaolong</author><author>Zhang, Yu</author><author>Wang, Aizhen</author><author>Xing, Yuling</author><author>Xu, Shunqing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transmission of corona virus disease 2019 during the incubation period may lead to a quarantine loophole</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.06.20031955</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.06.20031955</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: The ongoing outbreak of novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, is arousing international concern. This study evaluated whether and when the infected but asymptomatic cases during the incubation period could infect others. Methods: We collected data on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and symptom onset day of the confirmed cases, which had been announced by the Chinese local authorities. We evaluated the potential of transmission during the incubation period in 50 infection clusters, including 124 cases. All the secondary cases had a history of contact with their first-generation cases prior to symptom onset. Results: The estimated mean incubation period for COVID-19 was 4.9 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4 to 5.4) days, ranging from 0.8 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile). The observed mean and standard deviation (SD) of serial interval was 4.1±3.3 days, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles at -1 and 13 days. The infectious curve showed that in 73.0% of the secondary cases, their date of getting infected was before symptom onset of the first-generation cases, particularly in the last three days of the incubation period. Conclusions: The results indicated the transmission of COVID-9 occurs among close contacts during the incubation period, which may lead to a quarantine loophole. Strong and effective countermeasures should be implemented to prevent or mitigate asymptomatic transmission during the incubation period in populations at high risk.

Travel-associated cases have also been reported in other countries. The number of cases has increased rapidly but laboratory diagnosis is limited. METHODS: We collect two groups of cases diagnosed with COVID-19 for experiments. One group collected 63 samples for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG and IgM antibodies. The other group collected 91 plasma samples for colloidal gold-immunochromatographic assay (GICA). RESULTS: The sensitivity of the combined ELISA IgM and ELISA IgG detection was 55/63 ( 87.3%), The sensitivity of the combined GICA IgM and GICA IgG detection was 75/91 ( 82.4%), Both methods are negative for healthy controls, specificity of 100% .There is no significant difference between the sensitivity of between ELISA and GICA (IgM+ IgG). CONCLUSIONS: ELISA and GICA for specific IgM and IgG antibodies are conventional serological assays, they are simple, fast, and safe, the results can be used for clinical reference, and the huge clinical diagnosis and treatment pressure can be greatly relieved.

While it's evident that the virus invades respiratory tract and transmits from human to human through airway, other viral tropisms and transmission routes remain unknown. We tested viral RNA in stool from 73 SARS-CoV-2-infected hospitalized patients using rRT-PCR. 53.42% of the patients tested positive in stool. 23.29% of the patients remained positive in feces even after the viral RNA decreased to undetectable level in respiratory tract. The viral RNA was also detected in gastrointestinal tissues. Furthermore, gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelia showed positive immunofluorescent staining of viral host receptor ACE2 and viral nucleocapsid protein in a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results provide evidence for gastrointestinal infection of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting its potential fecal-oral transmission route.

The new coronavirus shares high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a newly identified bat coronavirus. While bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses, whether 2019-nCoV has other hosts is still ambiguous. In this study, one coronavirus isolated from Malayan pangolins showed 100%, 98.2%, 96.7% and 90.4% amino acid identity with 2019-nCoV in the E, M, N and S genes, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one amino acid difference. Comparison of available genomes suggests 2019-nCoV might have originated from the recombination of a Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus. Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histopathological changes, and the circulating antibodies reacted with the S protein of 2019-nCoV. The isolation of a coronavirus that is highly related to 2019-nCoV in the pangolins suggests that these animals have the potential to act as the intermediate host of 2019-nCoV. The newly identified coronavirus in the most-trafficked mammal could represent a continuous threat to public health if wildlife trade is not effectively controlled.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xiao, Shu-Yuan</author><author>Wu, Yingjie</author><author>Liu, Huan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evolving status of the 2019 novel coronavirus Infection: proposal of conventional serologic assays for disease diagnosis and infection monitoring [Commentary/Review]</title><secondary-title>Journal of medical virology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of medical virology</full-title></periodical><pages>10.1002/jmv.25702</pages><keywords><keyword>antibody</keyword><keyword>coronavirus</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>nCoV-2019</keyword><keyword>pneumonia</keyword><keyword>serologic assay</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jmv.25702</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031264</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) outbreak in Wuhan, China has spread rapidly nationwide, with some cases occurring in other parts of the world. Although most patients present with mild febrile illness with patchy pulmonary inflammation, a significant portion develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a current case fatality of 2.3-3%. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and laboratory and chest radiographic findings, but confirmation currently relies on nucleic acid-based assays. The latter are playing an important role in facilitating patient isolation, treatment and assessment of infectious activities. However, due to their limited capacity to handle an epidemic of the current scale and insufficient supply of assay kits, only a portion of suspected cases can be tested, leading to incompleteness and inaccuracy in updating new cases, as well as delayed diagnosis. Furthermore, there has not been enough time to assess specificity and sensitivity. Conventional serological assays, such as enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for specific IgM and IgG antibodies, should offer a high-throughput alternative, which allows for uniform tests for all suspected patients, and can facilitate more complete identification of infected cases and avoidance of unnecessary cross infection among unselected patients.

We propose a Cybernetics-based Dynamic Infection Model (CDIM) to the dynamic infection process with a probability distributed incubation delay and feedback principle. Reproductive trends and the stability of the SARS-COV-2 infection in a city can then be analyzed, and the uncontrollable risks can be forecasted before they really happen. The infection mechanism of a city is depicted using the philosophy of cybernetics and approaches of the control engineering. Distinguished with other epidemiological models, such as SIR, SEIR, etc., that compute the theoretical number of infected people in a closed population, CDIM considers the immigration and emigration population as system inputs, and administrative and medical resources as dynamic control variables. The epidemic regulation can be simulated in the model to support the decision-making for containing the outbreak. City case studies are demonstrated for verification and validation.

Search Query performs well in forecasting the epidemics. It is still a question whether search engine data can forecast the drift and the inflexion in 2019-nCov pneumonia. Based on the Baidu Search Index, we propose three prediction models: composite Index, composite Index with filtering and suspected NCP(Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia). The result demonstrates that the predictive model of composite index with filtering performs the best while the model of suspected NCP has the highest forecast error. We further predict the out-of-the-set NCP confirmed cases and monitor that the next peak of new diagnoses will occur on February 16th and 17th.

Protein-protein interaction structure modeling indicates that spike-RBD of the two viruses also has similar overall binding conformation and binding free energy to ACE2. In vitro assays using recombinant ACE2 proteins and ACE2 expressing cells confirmed the two coronaviruses' similar binding affinities to ACE2. The above studies provide experimental supporting evidences and possible explanation for the high transmissibility observed in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Potent ACE2-blocking SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies showed limited cross-binding and neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2. ACE2-non-blocking SARS-CoV RBD antibodies, though with weaker neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV, showed positive cross-neutralizing activities to SARS-CoV-2 with an unknown mechanism. These findings suggest a trade-off between the efficacy and spectrum for therapeutic antibodies to different coronaviruses, and hence highlight the possibilities and challenges in developing broadly protecting antibodies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and its future mutants.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xie, Qing</author><author>Wang, Jing</author><author>You, Jianling</author><author>Zhu, Shida</author><author>Zhou, Rui</author><author>Tian, Zhijian</author><author>Wu, Hao</author><author>Lin, Yang</author><author>Chen, Wei</author><author>Xiao, Lan</author><author>Jin, Xin</author><author>Li, Jianjuan</author><author>Dong, Jie</author><author>Wu, Honglong</author><author>Zhang, Wei</author><author>Li, Jing</author><author>Xu, Xun</author><author>Yin, Ye</author><author>Mu, Feng</author><author>Chen, Weijun</author><author>Wang, Jian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of large-scale testing platform in prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic: an empirical study with a novel numerical model</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.15.20036624</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.15.20036624</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: China adopted an unprecedented province-scale quarantine since January 23rd 2020, after the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan in December 2019. Responding to the challenge of limited testing capacity, large-scale standardized and fully-automated laboratory (Huo-Yan) was built as an ad-hoc measure. There was so far no empirical data or mathematical model to reveal the impact of the testing capacity improvement since the quarantine. Methods: We integrated public data released by the Health Commission of Hubei Province and Huo-Yan Laboratory testing data into a novel differential model with non-linear transfer coefficients and competitive compartments, to evaluate the trends of suspected cases under different nucleic acid testing capacities. Results: Without the establishment of Huo-Yan, the suspected cases would increased by 47% to 33,700, the corresponding cost of the quarantine would be doubled, and the turning point of the increment of suspected cases and the achievement of &quot;daily settlement&quot; (all daily new discovered suspected cases were diagnosed according to the nucleic acid testing results) would be delayed for a whole week and 11 days. If the Huo-Yan Laboratory could ran at its full capacity, the number of suspected cases could started to decrease at least a week earlier, the peak of suspected cases would be reduced by at least 44% and the quarantine cost could be reduced by more than 72%. Ideally, if a daily testing capacity of 10,500 could achieved immediately after the Hubei lockdown, &quot;daily settlement&quot; for all suspected cases would be achieved immediately. Conclusions: Large-scale and standardized clinical testing platform with nucleic acid testing, high-throughput sequencing and immunoprotein assessment capabilities need to be implemented simultaneously in order to maximize the effect of quarantine and minimize the duration and cost. Such infrastructure like Huo-Yan, is of great significance for the early prevention and control of infectious diseases for both common times and emergencies.

There is a paucity of data concerning coinfection with other common respiratory pathogens in COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan. Methods: We conducted a double-centre study recruiting 68 patients with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing in Qingdao and Wuhan from January 17 to February 16, 2020. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the specific IgM antibody against common respiratory pathogens in collected acute phase serum. Results: Of the 68 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 30 (44.12%) were from Qingdao. The median age of Qingdao and Wuhan patients were 50 (IQR: 37-59) and 31 (IQR: 28-38) years, respectively, and the majority of patients were female in Qingdao (60.00%) and Wuhan (55.26%). Among COVID-19 patients in Qingdao, 24 (80.00%) of them had IgM antibodies against at least one respiratory pathogen, whereas only one (2.63%) of the patients in Wuhan had positive results for serum IgM antibody detection (P&lt;0.0001). The most common respiratory pathogens detected in Qingdao COVID-19 patients were influenza virus A (60.00%) and influenza virus B (53.33%), followed by mycoplasma pneumoniae (23.33%) and legionella pneumophila (20.00%). While the pattern for coinfection in patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Qingdao was quite different, with a positive rate of only 20.90%. Interpretation: We reported a large proportion of COVID-19 patients with coinfection of seasonal respiratory pathogens in Qingdao, northeast China, which differed greatly from the patients in Wuhan, central China. Precautions are needed when dealing with COVID-19 patients beyond the epidemic centre who have coinfection with other respiratory pathogens. We highly recommend adding SARS-CoV-2 to routine diagnostic testing in capable hospitals to prevent misdetection of the virus. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This research was supported by The National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [Grant number 81770315]; and Distinguished Taishan Scholars (2019). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 has been constantly reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most published studies focus on adult populations, whereas data concerning pediatric patients is relatively scarce. Methods: From January 17, 2020 to March 6, 2020, three pediatric cases of COVID-19 were reported in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment data of these children were collected. Real-time fluorescence reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and fecal specimens. Results: All the three pediatric cases were household contacts of adults whose symptoms developed earlier. There has been no evidence showing the virus was transmitted from the children to others. Severity of disease of these children was mild to moderate and fever was the most consistent and predominant symptom at onset of illness (two cases had body temperature higher than 38.5 Celsius). All children showed increased lymphocytes (&gt;4.4*109/L) with normal white blood cell counts on admission. One child had elevated serum levels of procalcitonin and C-reaction protein. Radiological changes were not typical for COVID-19. All children showed good response to supportive treatment. Clearance of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory tract occurred within two weeks after abatement of fever, whereas persistent presence of viral RNA was found in stools of all children. One case had fecal SARS-CoV-2 turned negative 8 days after throat swabs showing negative, while that of another child lagged behind for 20 days. At the time of writing, one child still had positive results for RT-PCR analysis in stools after negative conversion of viral RNA in respiratory samples (over 19 days behind). Conclusions: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 are very different from adult patients in regards to epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics. Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in stools of infected children indicates the potential for the virus to be transmitted through fecal excretion. Massive efforts should be made at all levels to prevent spreading of the infection among children after reopening of kindergartens and schools.

As of 28 January 2020, there were 4631 confirmed cases and 106 deaths, and 11 countries or regions were affected.Methods We downloaded the genomes of 2019-nCoVs and similar isolates from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Database (GISAID and nucleotide database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Lasergene 7.0 and MEGA 6.0 softwares were used to calculate genetic distances of the sequences, to construct phylogenetic trees, and to align amino acid sequences. Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis, implemented in the BEAST software package, was used to calculate the molecular clock related characteristics such as the nucleotide substitution rate and the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs.Results An isolate numbered EPI_ISL_403928 showed different phylogenetic trees and genetic distances of the whole length genome, the coding sequences (CDS) of ployprotein (P), spike protein (S), and nucleoprotein (N) from other 2019-nCoVs. There are 22, 4, 2 variations in P, S, and N at the level of amino acid residues. The nucleotide substitution rates from high to low are 1·05 × 10−2 (nucleotide substitutions/site/year, with 95% HPD interval being 6.27 × 10−4 to 2.72 × 10−2) for N, 5.34 × 10−3 (5.10 × 10−4, 1.28 × 10−2) for S, 1.69 × 10−3 (3.94 × 10−4, 3.60 × 10−3) for P, 1.65 × 10−3 (4.47 × 10−4, 3.24 × 10−3) for the whole genome, respectively. At this nucleotide substitution rate, the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 2019-nCoVs appeared about 0.253-0.594 year before the epidemic.Conclusion Our analysis suggests that at least two different viral strains of 2019-nCoV are involved in this outbreak that might occur a few months earlier before it was officially reported.CoVsCoronaviruses2019-nCoV2019-novel coronavirusSARS-CoVsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirusMERS-CoVMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirusCDScoding sequencetMRCAthe most recent common ancestorGISAIDthe Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza DatabaseESSsEffective sample sizes</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xiong, Hao</author><author>Yan, Huili</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Simulating the infected population and spread trend of 2019-nCov under different policy by EIR model</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.10.20021519</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.10.20021519</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Chinese government has taken strong measures in response to the epidemic of new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Jan.23, 2020. The number of confirmed infected individuals are still increasing rapidly. Estimating the accurate infected population and the future trend of epidemic spreading under control measures is significant and urgent. There have been reports external icon of spread from an infected patient with no symptoms to a close contact, which means the incubation individuals may has the possibility of infectiousness. However, the traditional transmission model, Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, assumes that the exposed individual is being infected but without infectiousness. Thus, the estimating infected populations based on SEIR model from the existing literatures seems too far more than the official reported data. Here, we inferred that the epidemic could be spread by exposed (incubation) individuals. Then, we provide a new Exposed-identified-Recovered (EIR) model, and simulated the epidemic spreading processes from free propagation phase to extremely control phase. Then, we estimate of the size of the epidemic and forecast the future development of the epidemics under strong prevention interventions. According to the spread characters of 2019-nCov, we construct a novel EIR compartment system dynamics model. This model integrates two phases of the epidemic spreading: before intervention and after intervention. We assume that 2019-nCov is firstly spread without intervention then the government started to take strong quarantine measures. Use the latest reported official data, we estimate the basic parameters of the model and the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCov. Then, based on this model, we simulate the future spread of the epidemics. Both the infected population and the spreading trend of 2019-nCov under different prevention policy scenarios are estimated. The epidemic spreading trends under different quarantine rate and action starting date of prevention policy are simulated and compared.

Existing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs cannot be applied immediately to new viruses because of virus-specificity, and the development of new DAA drugs from the beginning is not timely for outbreaks. Thus, host-targeting antiviral (HTA) drugs have many advantages to fight against a broad spectrum of viruses, by blocking the viral replication and overcoming the potential viral mutagenesis simultaneously. Herein, we identified two potent inhibitors of DHODH, S312 and S416, with favorable drug-like and pharmacokinetic profiles, which all showed broad-spectrum antiviral effects against various RNA viruses, including influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, H9N2), Zika virus, Ebola virus, and particularly against the recent novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Our results are the first to validate that DHODH is an attractive host target through high antiviral efficacy in vivo and low virus replication in DHODH knocking-out cells. We also proposed the drug combination of DAA and HTA was a promising strategy for anti-virus treatment and proved that S312 showed more advantageous than Oseltamivir to treat advanced influenza diseases in severely infected animals. Notably, S416 is reported to be the most potent inhibitor with an EC50 of 17nM and SI value &gt;5882 in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells so far. This work demonstrates that both our self-designed candidates and old drugs (Leflunomide/Teriflunomide) with dual actions of antiviral and immuno-repression may have clinical potentials not only to influenza but also to COVID-19 circulating worldwide, no matter such viruses mutate or not.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Huayan</author><author>Hou, Keke</author><author>Xu, Hong</author><author>Li, Zhenlin</author><author>Chen, Huizhu</author><author>Zhang, Na</author><author>Xu, Rong</author><author>Fu, Hang</author><author>Sun, Ran</author><author>Wen, Lingyi</author><author>Xie, Linjun</author><author>Liu, Hui</author><author>Zhang, Kun</author><author>Selvanayagam, Joseph B</author><author>Fu, Chuan</author><author>Zhao, Shihua</author><author>Yang, Zhigang</author><author>Yang, Ming</author><author>Guo, Yingkun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Acute Myocardial Injury of Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.05.20031591</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.05.20031591</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them. Methods: We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and AMI (n=6). All the six AMI patients were aged &gt;60 years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI (p&lt;0.001). All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Cardiac complications are common in COVID-19 patients. Elevated CRP levels, underlying comorbidities, and NCP severity are the main risk factors for cardiac complications in COVID-19 patients.

We developed a new treatment model based on the online-to-offline (O2O) model for the home isolated patients, because in the early stages the medical staff were insufficient to cope with so many patients. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective study, we enrolled 48 confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients who underwent home isolation in Wuhan between January 6 and January 31, 2020. By WeChat and online document editing all patients were treated with medical observation scale. The clinical indications such as Fever, Muscle soreness, Dyspnea and Lack of strength were collected with this system led by medical staff in management, medicine, nursing, rehabilitation and psychology. Findings The mean(SD) age of 48 patients was 39.08(13.88) years, 35(72.9%) were women. Compared with non-hospitalized patients, inpatients were older(≥8805;70years, 2.4% vs 33.3%, P&lt;0.04). All inpatients had fever, 50% inpatients had coughs and showed infiltration in both lungs at the time of diagnosis. 33.3% inpatients exhibited negative changes in their CT results at initial diagnosis. The body temperature of non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms returned to normal by day 4-5. While dyspnea peaked on day 6 for non-hospitalized patients with mild symptoms, it persisted in hospitalized patients and exacerbated over time. The lack of strength and muscle soreness were both back to normal by day 4 for non-hospitalized patients. Interpretation Monitoring the trends of symptoms is more important for identifying severe cases. Excessive laboratory data and physical examination are not necessary for the evaluation of patients with mild symptoms. The system we developed is the first to convert the subjective symptoms of patients into objective scores. This type of O2O, subjective-to-objective strategy may be used in regions with similar highly infectious diseases to minimize the possibility of infection among medical staff. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No funding. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Recently, a new emerged HCoV isolated from the respiratory epithelium of unexplained pneumonia patients in the Wuhan seafood market caused a major disease outbreak and has been named the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus causes acute lung symptoms, leading to a condition that has been named as “coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV caused widespread fear and concern and has threatened global health security. There are some similarities and differences in the epidemiology and clinical features between these two viruses and diseases that are caused by these viruses. The goal of this work is to systematically review and compare between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the context of their virus incubation, originations, diagnosis and treatment methods, genomic and proteomic sequences, and pathogenic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Jie</author><author>Cheng, Yajiao</author><author>Yuan, Xiaoling</author><author>Li, Wei V.</author><author>Zhang, Lanjing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Trends and prediction in daily incidence of novel coronavirus infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City: an application of Farr law</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.19.20025148</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.19.20025148</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has infected tens of thousands of patients in China. Studies have forecasted future trends of the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection, but appeared unsuccessful. Farr law is a classic epidemiology theory/practice for predicting epidemics. Therefore, we used and validated a model based on Farr law to predict the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China and 2 regions of high-incidence. Methods: We extracted the 2019-nCoV incidence data of China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City from websites of the Chinese and Hubei health commissions. A model based on Farr law was developed using the data available on Feb. 8, 2020, and used to predict daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV infection in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City afterward. Results: We observed 50,995 (37001 on or before Feb. 8) incident cases in China from January 16 to February 15, 2020. The daily-incidence has peaked in China, Hubei Providence and Wuhan City, but with different downward slopes. If no major changes occur, our model shows that the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV will drop to single-digit by February 25 for China and Hubei Province, but by March 8 for Wuhan city. However, predicted 75% confidence intervals of daily-incidence in all 3 regions of interest had an upward trend. The predicted trends overall match the prospectively-collected data, confirming usefulness of these models. Conclusions: This study shows the daily-incidence of 2019-nCoV in China, Hubei Province and Wuhan City has reached the peak and was decreasing. However, there is a possibility of upward trend.

We report the laboratory results of conjunctival PCR-tests and some clinical features of these patients in shenyang China. Design: This is a cross-sectional non-randomized study. Subjects: The study include 14 confirmly diagnosed cases, 16 suspected cases and some medical observed patients. Methods: All patients with diagnosed and suspected COVID-19 were admitted to a designated hospital in Shenyang,China. We collected conjunctival samples of these patients to do the laboratory tests by real time RT-PCR.Medical observed patients were enrolled if they had clinical symptoms. Then we analysed the PCR results and clinical data from eletronic medical records in order to find some relationships. Main Outcome Measures: Clinical condition and PCR results of conjunctival swabs compared with other specimens. Results: One of the identified case coverted from suspected case without typical clinical symptoms. Twenty-two medical observed cases were removed because none of them converted to identified cases.One of the suspected converted to identified case recently.The included cases in our study are imported cases with less underlying diseases and the severity of their infection was relatively moderate. All the conjunctival results of PCR-test were negative. Two cases had typical clinical symptoms but were finally confirmed by repeated pharynx swab tests. Conclusion: Conjunctiva may be a transmission way of COVID-19. And ocular conjunctival swabs in combination with PCR test could be a non-invasive,convenient and feasible diagnostic method for identifying the infection of COVID-19. Emphasis on the false-negative results is vital. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement Ministry of Shenyang science and technology ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Wenzhou, as a southeast coastal city with the most cases outside Hubei Province, its policy control and epidemic projections have certain references for national and worldwide epidemic prevention and control. The maximum number of illness onset in Wenzhou appeared on January 26 (38 cases). Since January 27, the incidence per day in Wenzhou has continued to decline is likely to be due to isolation of people return to Wenzhou, implementation of region quarantine and suspension of public transportation system. Under the current control efforts, we estimate that the daily incidence by March 3-9, 2020 will drop to 0 in Wenzhou using SEIR model. The total number of affected people is 538.

Currently, a novel human coronavirus has caused a major disease outbreak, and named corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The emergency of MRES-COV and COVID-19 has caused global panic and threatened health security. Unfortunately, the similarities and differences between the two coronavirus diseases remain to be unknown. The aim of this study, therefore, is to perform a systematic review to compare epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19 and MERS-COV population. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials database to identify potential studies reported COVID-19 or MERS-COV. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory outcomes, the admission rate of intensive cure unit (ICU), discharge rate and fatality rate were evaluated using GraphPad Prism software. Thirty-two studies involving 3770 patients (COVID-19 = 1062, MERS-COV = 2708) were included in this study. The present study revealed that compared with COVID-19 population, MERS-COV population had a higher rate of ICU admission, discharge and fatality and longer incubation time. It pointed out that fever, cough and generalised weakness and myalgia were main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and MERS-COV, whereas ARDS was main complication. The most effective drug for MERS-COV is ribavirin and interferon.

Design Retrospective case series.

Setting Seven hospitals in Zhejiang province, China.

Participants 62 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection. Data were collected from 10 January 2020 to 26 January 2020.

Main outcome measures Clinical data, collected using a standardised case report form, such as temperature, history of exposure, incubation period. If information was not clear, the working group in Hangzhou contacted the doctor responsible for treating the patient for clarification.

Results Of the 62 patients studied (median age 41 years), only one was admitted to an intensive care unit, and no patients died during the study. According to research, none of the infected patients in Zhejiang province were ever exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the original source of the virus; all studied cases were infected by human to human transmission. The most common symptoms at onset of illness were fever in 48 (77%) patients, cough in 50 (81%), expectoration in 35 (56%), headache in 21 (34%), myalgia or fatigue in 32 (52%), diarrhoea in 3 (8%), and haemoptysis in 2 (3%). Only two patients (3%) developed shortness of breath on admission. The median time from exposure to onset of illness was 4 days (interquartile range 3-5 days), and from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 2 (1-4) days.

Conclusion As of early February 2020, compared with patients initially infected with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan, the symptoms of patients in Zhejiang province are relatively mild.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Xiaoke</author><author>Liu, Xiaofan</author><author>Wu, Ye</author><author>Ali, Sheikh Taslim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Close contacts and household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in China: a content analysis based on local Heath Commissions' public disclosures.</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.02.20029868</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.02.20029868</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Public disclosure from Chinese local Health Commissions show that male and mid-aged index patients are the major source of virus from outside to the households. This implies that two important actions should be taken in disease control. First considers the kindergarten and school closure time. Local kindergarten and primary schools should postpone their admission and regular operation, to at least not earlier than local secondary schools. Second, workplace hygiene is of particular important in the next phase of disease control. As travel restrictions within China are being gradually lifted, we suggest that workplace hygiene should be taken serious care in the next month or two. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61773091). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

The manifestations of computed tomography (CT) imaging of COVID-19 had their own characteristics, which are different from other types of viral pneumonia, such as Influenza-A viral pneumonia. Therefore, clinical doctors call for another early diagnostic criteria for this new type of pneumonia as soon as possible.This study aimed to establish an early screening model to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from Influenza-A viral pneumonia and healthy cases with pulmonary CT images using deep learning techniques. The candidate infection regions were first segmented out using a 3-dimensional deep learning model from pulmonary CT image set. These separated images were then categorized into COVID-19, Influenza-A viral pneumonia and irrelevant to infection groups, together with the corresponding confidence scores using a location-attention classification model. Finally the infection type and total confidence score of this CT case were calculated with Noisy-or Bayesian function.The experiments result of benchmark dataset showed that the overall accuracy was 86.7 % from the perspective of CT cases as a whole.The deep learning models established in this study were effective for the early screening of COVID-19 patients and demonstrated to be a promising supplementary diagnostic method for frontline clinical doctors.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Xintian</author><author>Chen, Ping</author><author>Wang, Jingfang</author><author>Feng, Jiannan</author><author>Zhou, Hui</author><author>Li, Xuan</author><author>Zhong, Wu</author><author>Hao, Pei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evolution of the novel coronavirus from the ongoing Wuhan outbreak and modeling of its spike protein for risk of human transmission</title><secondary-title>Science China Life Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science China Life Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>China</pub-location><accession-num>32009228</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5</electronic-resource-num><notes>32009228[pmid] 10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5[PII]</notes><research-notes>32009228[pmid] 10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5[PII]</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32009228</url><url>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11427-020-1637-5</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Yang</author><author>Li, Yi-rong</author><author>Zeng, Qiang</author><author>Lu, Zhi-bing</author><author>Li, Yong-zhe</author><author>Wu, Wei</author><author>Dong, Sheng-yong</author><author>Huang, Gang</author><author>Wang, Xing-huan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 Pneumonia Compared to Controls in Chinese Han Population</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.08.20031658</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.08.20031658</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background In December 2019, novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected pneumonia occurred in Wuhan, China. The number of cases has increased rapidly but information on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without comorbidities compared to normal controls in Chinese Han population is limited. Our objective is to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without comorbidities compared to normal controls in the Chinese Han population. Methods Retrospective, multi-center case series of the 69 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, from February 7 to February 28, 2020; final date of follow-up was February 29, 2020. Results The study population included 69 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia without comorbidities and 14,117 normal controls. 50.7% patients were male and 49.3% were female; 1.5% patients were asymptomatic cases, 63.8% patients were mild cases, and 36.2% patients were severe or critical cases. Compared with mild patients (n = 44), severe or critical patients (n = 25) were significantly older (median age, 67 years [IQR, 58-79] vs. 49 years [IQR, 36-60]; P &lt; 0.01). Fever was present in 98.6% of the patients. The second most common symptom was cough (62.3%), fatigue (58.0%), sputum (39.1%), and headache (33.3%). The median incubation period was 4 days (IQR, 2 to 7). Leukocyte count was 74.1% of normal controls and lymphocyte count was 45.9% of normal controls. The phenomenon of lymphocyte depletion (PLD) observed in severe or critical cases in 100%. Levels of lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, procalcitonin, and interleukin-6 were showed significant differences between mild and severe or critical cases. Chest computed tomographic scans showed bilateral patchy patterns (49.3%), local patchy shadowing (29.0%), and ground glass opacity (21.7%). 7.3% patients were diagnosed ARDS, 7.3% patients were diagnosed acute cardiac injury (troponin I &gt;28 pg/mL) and 4.4% patients were diagnosed fungal infections or shock. 4.3% patients have been discharged; 1.5% patient had died; 1.5% patient had recovery. Conclusions In this multicenter case series of 69 patients without comorbidities, the full spectrum of asymptomatic, mild, severe, and critical cases is described. 50.7% patients were male and 49.3% were female; 1.5% patients were asymptomatic cases, 63.8% patients were mild cases, and 36.2% patients were severe or critical cases. 4.3% patients have been discharged; 1.5% patient had died; 1.5% patient had recovery. Among the 25 patients with severe or critical disease, 12.0% patients were underwent non-invasive mechanical ventilation, 8.0% patients underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 4.0% patients died.

The mortality of critical illness was high in Wuhan. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection outside of Wuhan is scarce. We aimed to provide the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of the critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Guangdong Province. Methods In this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Guangdong Province. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, treatments, and prognosis were collected. Data were compared between patients with and without intubation. Results Forty-five critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were identified in 7 ICUs in Guangdong Province. The mean age was 56.7 years, and 29 patients (64.4%) were men. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were high fever and cough. Majority of patients presented with lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Treatment with antiviral drugs was initiated in all the patients. Thirty-seven patients (82.2%) had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 13 (28.9%) septic shock. A total of 20 (44.4%) patients required intubation and 9 (20%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. As of February 28th 2020, only one patient (2.2%) had died and half of them had discharged of ICU. Conclusions Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in critical illness is characterized by fever, lymphopenia, acute respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction. Compared with critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, the mortality of critically ill patients in Guangdong Province was relatively low. These data provide some general understandings and experience for the critical patients with SARS-CoV-2 outside of Wuhan.

We built homology models based on SARS Mpro structures, and docked 1903 small molecule drugs to the models. Based on the docking score and the 3D similarity of the binding mode to the known Mpro ligands, 4 drugs were selected for binding free energy calculations. Both MM/GBSA and SIE methods voted for nelfinavir, with the binding free energy of −24.69±0.52 kcal/mol and −9.42±0.04 kcal/mol, respectively.

Till date, 77,041 confirmed Chinese cases have been reported by National Health Commission of P.R. China with 9,126 critical cases whose survival rate is quite low. Meanwhile, COVID-19 epidemic emergence within the other countries (e.g., Korea, Italy, Japan and Iran) is also remarkable with the increasing spread speed. It plays a more and more important role to efficiently and precisely predict the survival rate for critically ill Covid-19 patients as more fatal cases can be targeted interfered in advanced. However, the survival rates of all the present critically ill COVID -19 patients are estimated manually from over 300 laboratory and clinical features, which inevitably leads to high misdiagnose and missed-diagnose rate due to lack of experience and priori knowledge. As a remedy, we have developed a machine learning-based prognostic model that precisely predicts the survival for individual severe patients with more than 90% accuracy with clinical data collected from Tongji hospital, Wuhan. Significantly, such model only requires three key clinical features, i.e., lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphocyte and High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) out of all 300+ features. The rationality of such mere three features may lie in that they are the representatives of tissue injury-, immunity- and inflammation-typed indices, respectively. From the COVID-19 patient diagnosis aspect, the work actualizes low-cost and prompt criticality classification and survival prediction before targeted intervening and diagnosis, especially for the triage of the large-scale explosive epidemic COVID -19 cases.

Like other coronaviruses such as the SARS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV uses the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) to engage ACE2. We most recently determined the structure of the full-length human ACE2 in complex with a neutral amino acid transporter BAT1. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the full-length human ACE2 bound to the RBD of the 2019-nCoV at an overall resolution of 2.9 Å in the presence of BAT1. The local resolution at the ACE2-RBD interface is 3.5 Å, allowing analysis of the detailed interactions between the RBD and the receptor. Similar to that for the SARS-CoV, the RBD of the 2019-nCoV is recognized by the extracellular peptidase domain (PD) of ACE2 mainly through polar residues. Pairwise comparison reveals a number of variations that may determine the different affinities between ACE2 and the RBDs from these two related viruses.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yan, Yong-Ming</author><author>Shen, Xin</author><author>Cao, Yong-Kai</author><author>Zhang, Jiao-Jiao</author><author>Wang, Yan</author><author>Cheng, Yong-Xian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Discovery of Anti-2019-nCoV Agents from 38 Chinese Patent Drugs toward Respiratory Diseases via Docking Screening</title><secondary-title>Preprints (www.preprints.org)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Preprints (www.preprints.org)</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>ACE2</keyword><keyword>docking</keyword><keyword>novel coronavirus pneumonia</keyword><keyword>viral main protease</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Preprints</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.20944/PREPRINTS202002.0254.V2</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202002.0254/v2</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, F</author><author>Liu, N</author><author>Wu, J Y</author><author>Hu, L L</author><author>Su, G S</author><author>Zheng, N S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Pulmonary rehabilitation guidelines in the principle of 4S for patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)]</title><secondary-title>Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi</full-title></periodical><pages>E004</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>0</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>2019 novel coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Antiviral therapy</keyword><keyword>Infection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>1001-0939 (Print)1001-0939</isbn><accession-num>32023687</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0004</electronic-resource-num><notes>Yang, F

Shenzhen ranked the top cities outside Wuhan with reported 416 confirmed cases by February 20, 2020. Here, we analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Shenzhen and potential link to the preventive strategies for the whole city and inside hospitals. Based on the daily new cases, the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen can be classified into three phases: the slow increase phase from January 19 to January 28, the rapid increase and plateau phase from January 29 to February 5 and the decline phase since February 6. In the three phases, the number of patients from Hubei decreased, and the number of familial clustering cases increased. The newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases reached its peak around January 31, which was 7 days after the peak date of cases arrival at Shenzhen. A series of early preventive strategies were implemented since January 19, which included detection of body temperature at all entrances of main traffic and buildings, outpatients service specially for patients with fever in all main hospitals in Shenzhen. All the patients with fever were screened with nasal or throat swab PCR detection of coronavirus 2019, Chest CT and blood lymphocyte counting in order to find out early case of COVID-19. Observation wards were established in every main hospital and a designated hospital was responsible for admission and medical care of all confirmed cases. Protection procedure was established for all medical staff involved in the screening and care of suspected and confirmed cases. 14 days isolated observation of all subjects arrived at Shenzhen from Hubei was implemented in February 2. After the implementation of all these strategies and measures, the COVID-19 cases started to decline since February 6. There were almost no community transmission and nosocomial infection occurred in Shenzhen. In conclusion, in situation of major outbreak of respiratory infectious disease, such as COVID-19, in nearby province of Hubei, Shenzhen, a high population density, high proportion of external population and high mobility city, has to face the imported cases and risk of spreading the outbreak into Shenzhen city. The implementation of early preventive strategies and measures in Shenzhen were successful in early identification of COVID-19 cases and prevented major outbreak occurred in Shenzhen. Early identification of imported cases, prevention of family clustering transmission, preventive measures in the public area and very strict infection control procedure in hospital setting are crucial for the successful control of outbreak in Shenzhen.

The features of COVID-19patients withand without pneumonia,SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility in asymptomatic carriers, and factors predicting disease progression remain unknown. Methods: We collected information on clinical characteristics, exposure history, andlaboratory examinations of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to PLA General Hospital. Cox regression analysis was applied to identify prognostic factors. The last follow-up was February 18, 2020. Results:We characterized 55 consecutive COVID-19 patients. The mean incubation was 8.42(95% confidence interval [CI], 6.55-10.29) days. The mean SARS-CoV-2-positive duration from first positive test to clearance was 9.71(95%CI, 8.21-11.22) days. COVID-19 course was approximately 2 weeks. Asymptomatic carriers might transmit SARS-CoV-2. Compared with patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia were 15 years older and had a higher rate of hypertension, higher frequencies of having a fever and cough, and higher levels of interleukin-6 (14.61 vs. 8.06pg/mL, P=0.040), B lymphocyte proportion (13.0% vs.10.0%, P=0.024), low account (&lt;190/μL) of CD8+ T cells (33.3% vs. 0, P=0.019). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that circulating interleukin-6 andlactate independently predicted COVID-19 progression, with a hazard ratio (95%CI) of 1.052 (1.000-1.107) and 1.082 (1.013-1.155), respectively. During disease course,T lymphocytes were generally lower,neutrophils higher, in pneumonia patients than in pneumonia-free patients. CD8+ lymphocytes did not increase at the 20th days after illness onset. Conclusion: The epidemiological features areimportant for COVID-19 prophylaxis. Circulating interleukin-6 and lactateare independent prognostic factors. CD8+ T cell exhaustion might be critical in the development of COVID-19.

Real- time fluorescent PCR (RT-PCR) is the clinical standard for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection. To detect SARS-CoV-2 early and control the disease spreading on time, a faster and more convenient method for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detecting, RT-LAMP method (reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification) was developed. RNA reverse transcription and nucleic acid amplification were performed in one step at 63 ℃ isothermal conditions, and the results can be obtained within 30 minutes. ORF1ab gene, E gene and N gene were detected at the same time. ORF1ab gene was very specific and N gene was very sensitivity, so they can guarantee both sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity of RT-LAMP assay is similar to RT-PCR, and specificity was 99% as detecting 208 clinical specimens. The RT-LAMP assay reported here has the advantages of rapid amplification, simple operation, and easy detection, which is useful for the rapid and reliable clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.

However, to pick out a reliable predictable model/method is far from simple, a rational evaluation of various possible choices is eagerly needed, especially under the severe threat of COVID-19 epidemics which is spreading worldwide right now. In this paper, based on the public COVID-19 data of seven provinces/cities in China reported during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference methods and five dynamical models widely used in the literature. We highlight the significance of a well balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting, as well as model robustness and sensitivity. We further introduce the Akaike information criterion, root mean square errors and robustness index to quantify these three golden means and to evaluate various epidemic models/methods. Through extensive simulations, we find that the inflection point plays a crucial role in the choice of the size of dataset in forecasting. Before the inflection point, no model considered here could make a reliable prediction. We further notice the Logistic function steadily underestimate the final epidemic size, while the Gomertz's function makes an overestimation in all cases. Since the methods of sequential Bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number take the non-constant nature of the effective reproduction number with the progression of epidemics into consideration, we suggest to employ them especially in the late stage of an epidemic. The transition-like behavior of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection point might be useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. Towards the dynamical models based on ODEs, it is observed that the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models generally show a better performance than SIR, SEIR and SEIR-AHQ models on the COVID-19 epidemics, whose success could be attributed to the inclusion of self-protection and quarantine, and a proper trade-off between model complexity and fitting accuracy.

Our previous study has shown that cytokine storm occurred during SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the detailed role of cytokines in the disease severity and progression remained unclear due to the limited case number. In this study, we examined 48 cytokines in the plasma samples from 53 COVID-19 cases, among whom 34 were severe cases, and the others moderate. Results showed that 14 cytokines were significantly elevated upon admission in COVID-19 cases. Moreover, IP-10, MCP-3, and IL-1ra were significantly higher in severe cases, and highly associated with the PaO2/FaO2 and Murray score. Furthermore, the three cytokines were independent predictors for the progression of COVID-19, and the combination of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra showed the biggest area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) calculations. Serial detection of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra in 14 severe cases showed that the continuous high levels of these cytokines were associated with disease deterioration and fatal outcome. In conclusion, we report three cytokines that closely associated with disease severity and outcome of COVID-19. These findings add to our understanding of the immunopathologic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which suggested novel therapeutic targets and strategy.

Methods: Respiratory samples including nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected from Guangdong CDC confirmed NCP patients, and viral RNAs were detected using a CFDA approved detection kit. Results were analyzed in combination with sample collection date and clinical information. Finding: Except for BALF, the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (74.4%~88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6%~73.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o). For samples collected ≥ 15 d.a.o, sputum and nasal swabs still possessed a high positive rate ranging from 42.9%~61.1%. The positive rate of throat swabs collected ≥ 8 d.a.o was low, especially in samples from mild cases. Viral RNAs could be detected in all the lower respiratory tract of severe cases, but not the mild cases. CT scan of cases 02, 07 and 13 showed typical viral pneumonia with ground glass opacity, while no viral RNAs were detected in first three or all the upper respiratory samples. Interpretation: Sputum is most accurate for laboratory diagnosis of NCP, followed by nasal swabs. Detection of viral RNAs in BLAF is necessary for diagnosis and monitoring of viruses in severe cases. CT scan could serve as an important make up for the diagnosis of NCP. Funding National Science and Technology Major Project, Sanming Project of Medicine and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation.

Methods: Respiratory samples including nasal swabs, throat swabs, sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected from Guangdong CDC confirmed NCP patients, and viral RNAs were detected using a CFDA approved detection kit. Results were analyzed in combination with sample collection date and clinical information. Finding: Except for BALF, the sputum possessed the highest positive rate (74.4%~88.9%), followed by nasal swabs (53.6%~73.3%) for both severe and mild cases during the first 14 days after illness onset (d.a.o). For samples collected ≥ 15 d.a.o, sputum and nasal swabs still possessed a high positive rate ranging from 42.9%~61.1%. The positive rate of throat swabs collected ≥ 8 d.a.o was low, especially in samples from mild cases. Viral RNAs could be detected in all the lower respiratory tract of severe cases, but not the mild cases. CT scan of cases 02, 07 and 13 showed typical viral pneumonia with ground glass opacity, while no viral RNAs were detected in first three or all the upper respiratory samples. Interpretation: Sputum is most accurate for laboratory diagnosis of NCP, followed by nasal swabs. Detection of viral RNAs in BLAF is necessary for diagnosis and monitoring of viruses in severe cases. CT scan could serve as an important make up for the diagnosis of NCP. Funding National Science and Technology Major Project, Sanming Project of Medicine and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation.

Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug's safety profile. RESULTS: Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 μM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 μM) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yaqian, Mao</author><author>Lin, Wei</author><author>Wen, Junping</author><author>Chen, Gang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV: a system review</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.20.20025601</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.20.20025601</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: In this article, we summarized the early epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of SARS and COVID-19 in different countries. Aim to provide recommendations for the understanding and prevention of COVID-19. Methods: By searching pubmed, we analyzed and compared the typical cases of SARS and COVID-19 in different countries in the early stage of the outbreak. Clinical records, laboratory results, imageological diagnosis and pathologic condition were retrospectively reviewed for these cases. This paper adopts the method of descriptive statistics and tables and graphs. Findings: Six SARS-related articles (N=337 participants) and 12 COVID-19-related articles (N=50,096 participants) were eligible for this systematic review. Fever, cough and Malaise/Fatigue were the most common symptoms in SARS and COVID-19. But in general, the clinical symptoms and signs of COVID-19 were not obvious. Compared with SARS, COVID-19 was transmitted in a more diverse way, from person to person, asymptomatic infected people and possible fecal-oral transmission, created the conditions for a large-scale spread. The mortality rates of SARS and COVID-19 were (7.7%) and (2.2%) respectively, but the overall infection rate of healthcare worker of COVID-19 (3.9%) was lower than that of SARS (40.0%). We also summarize the current reports on the pathology of COVID-19, we found that the pathological features of COVID-19 have greatly similar with SARS, which manifested as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interpretation: The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS and COVID-19 in China are very similar, but also difference. In general, COVID-19 is transmitted in more diverse ways and is more infectious, so the early recognition of disease by healthcare worker and patient is very important. Active and effective isolation measures for suspected and close contacts are necessary. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement None ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Hospitals are significant epicenters for the human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 for HCWs, patients, and visitors. No data has been reported on the details of hospital environmental contamination status in the epicenter of Wuhan. Objective To investigate the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 contaminates healthcare settings, including to identify function zones of the hospital with the highest contamination levels and to identify the most contaminated objects, and personal protection equipment (PPE) in Wuhan, China. Design A field investigation was conducted to collect the surface swabs in various environments in the hospital and a laboratory experiment was conducted to examine the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Setting Six hundred twenty-six surface samples were collected within the Zhongnan Medical Center in Wuhan, China in the mist of the COVID-19 outbreak between February 7 - February 27, 2020. Participants Dacron swabs were aseptically collected from the surfaces of 13 hospital function zones, five major objects, and three major personal protection equipment (PPE). The SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Main Outcomes and Measures SARS-CoV-2 RNAs Results The most contaminated zones were the intensive care unit specialized for taking care of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) (31.9%), Obstetric Isolation Ward specialized for pregnant women with NCP (28.1%), and Isolation Ward for NCP (19.6%). We classified the 13 zones into four contamination levels. The most contaminated objects are self-service printers (20.0%), desktop/keyboard (16.8%), and doorknob (16.0%). Both hand sanitizer dispensers (20.3%) and gloves (15.4%) were most contaminated PPE. Conclusions and Relevance Many surfaces were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 across the hospital in various patient care areas, commonly used objects, medical equipment, and PPE. The 13 hospital function zones were classified into four contamination levels. These findings emphasize the urgent need to ensure adequate environmental cleaning, strengthen infection prevention training, and improve infection prevention precautions among HCWs during the outbreak of COVID-19. The findings may have important implications for modifying and developing urgently needed policy to better protect healthcare workers during this ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.

However, limited data was available for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reactivation. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. METHODS Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (i.e., with throat swab samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan. 8 to Feb. 10, 2020. RESULTS All 55 patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19, and 5 (9%) patients who discharged from hospital presented with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. Among the 5 reactivated patients, other symptoms were also observed, including fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue. One of the 5 patients had progressive lymphopenia (from 1.3 to 0.56 × 109 cells per L) and progressive neutrophilia (from 4.5 to 18.28 × 109 cells per L). All 5 reactivated patients presented normal aminotransferase levels. Throat swab samples from the 5 reactivated patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, indicating all positive for the virus. CONCLUSIONS Findings from this small group of cases suggested that there was currently evidence for reactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and there might be no specific clinical characteristics to distinguish them.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ye, Jiachen</author><author>Hu, Qitong</author><author>Ji, Peng</author><author>Barthelemy, Marc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effect of interurban movements on the spatial distribution of population in China</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07276</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Understanding how interurban movements can modify the spatial distribution of the population is important for transport planning but is also a fundamental ingredient for epidemic modeling. We focus here on vacation trips (for all transportation modes) during the Chinese Lunar New Year and compare the results for 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating the spread of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We first show that these travel flows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial fluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. When flows are larger, they appear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations, creating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. These movements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population concentration in a small set of cities. We characterize quantitatively the return to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us to show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 Lunar New Year due to travel restrictions. Travel restrictions obviously limit the spread of the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter-effect of keeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring intra-city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited. These results shed some light on how interurban movements modify the national distribution of populations, a crucial ingredient for devising effective control strategies at a national level.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yi, Huiguang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>2019 novel coronavirus is undergoing active recombination</title><secondary-title>Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America</full-title></periodical><pages>ciaa219</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/cid/ciaa219</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32130405</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ying, Songmin</author><author>Li, Fei</author><author>Geng, Xinwei</author><author>Li, Zhouyang</author><author>Du, Xufei</author><author>Chen, Haixia</author><author>Chen, Sisi</author><author>Zhang, Min</author><author>Shao, Zhehua</author><author>Wu, Yinfang</author><author>Syeda, Madiha Zahra</author><author>Yan, Fugui</author><author>Che, Luanqing</author><author>Zhang, Bin</author><author>Lou, Jian</author><author>Wang, Shaobin</author><author>Chen, Zhengming</author><author>Li, Wen</author><author>Shen, Ye</author><author>Chen, Zhihua</author><author>Shen, Huahao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spread and control of COVID-19 in China and their associations with population movement, public health emergency measures, and medical resources</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.24.20027623</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.24.20027623</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>ABSTRACT BACKGROUND The COVID-19 epidemic, first emerged in Wuhan during December 2019, has spread globally. While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in China. METHODS Spearman's correlation analysis was performed between official data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from Jan 20th to Feb 19th, 2020 and real-time travel data and health resources data. RESULTS There were 74,675 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China by Feb 19th, 2020. The overall fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p&lt;0.001; City r=0.6311, p&lt;0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p&lt;0.001; City r=0.6358, p&lt;0.001). The local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with reduced infections nationwide. Moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p&lt;0.001) and infection rates (r=-0.4912, p&lt;0.01). Similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r=-0.4791, p&lt;0.01) and lower cure rates (r=0.5286, p&lt;0.01) among the confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS The spread of the COVID-19 in China in its early phase was attributed primarily to population movement from Hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved prognosis of affected individuals.

As of February 11, 2020, a total of 44730 cases of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia associated with COVID-19 were confirmed by the National Health Commission of China. Methods: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers. Results: A total of 71 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 67 dates of infections were identified among 5405 confirmed cases outside Hubei as reported by February 2, 2020. Based on this information, we find the serial interval having an average of 4.41 days with a standard deviation of 3.17 days and the infectious period having an average of 10.91 days with a standard deviation of 3.95 days. Conclusions: The controlled reproduction number is declining. It is lower than one in most regions of China, but is still larger than one in Hubei Province. Sustained efforts are needed to further reduce the Rc to below one in order to end the current epidemic. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No funding. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

[Methods] From December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020, Analysis of 66,492 confirmed cases of NCP in China mainland. [Results] From December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020, a total of 66,492 cases of NCP were confirmed in China mainland, a total of 54,406 cases were confirmed in Hubei Province, a total of 37,914 cases were confirmed in Wuhan city. On February 5, 2020, the number of suspected cases of NCP in China mainland reached a maximum of 5,328. Since then, the suspected cases have shown a significant downward trend. On February 4, 2020, the number of confirmed cases has gradually decreased in China mainland since then. On February 12, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of NCP in China mainland increased explosively to 15,152, and then began to decline. From February 3, 2020, except for Hubei Province, In China mainland, the number of newly confirmed cases of NCP has continued to decline; From December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020, a total of 1,523 cases of NCP deaths in China mainland, a cumulative cure of 8096 cases, and mortality and cure rate were 2.29% (1523/66492) and 12.18% (8096/66492) respectively; Starting from January 27, 2020, The spread index of NCP gradually declined, and the extinction index of NCP rose little by little from January 29, 2020. [Conclusion] Starting from February 5, 2020, the number of suspected cases of the NCP is gradually decrease in China mainland. From February 3, 2020, the number of newly confirmed cases of NCP is continuous decline in China mainland except Hubei Province, This shows that the control of the transmission of NCP has achieved. Judged from the number of confirmed cases of NCP, controlling the outbreak in China mainland is to control the epidemic in Hubei province, and the key to controlling the outbreak in Hubei province is to control the epidemic in Wuhan city; Judging from the gradual increase in the number and cure rate of the NCP, and the gradual decline in the number of deaths and mortality, the trend of outbreak control and treatment is getting better; A decrease of the NCP spread index indicates a slowdown in the spread of the virus, but the cumulative confirmed cases is still increase, so the epidemic will continue for some time. However, the turning point of the epidemic in mainland China has not yet occurred. On February 12, 2020, the turning point of the epidemic in China mainland except Hubei province, has turned up.

This new type of pneumonia is characterized by rapid human-to-human transmission. Among the different disease types, cancer patients are often recalled to the hospital for treatment and disease surveillance, and the majority of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are immunosuppressive. This prompts us to consider if cancer patients were at an elevated risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A total of 1,524 cancer patients who were managed at our tertiary cancer institution-Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University were reviewed during the period of Dec 30, 2019 to Feb 17, 2020. It was found that cancer patients had an estimated 2-fold increased risk of COVID-19 than the general population. We identified twelve patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2, with two recorded deaths (16.7%), albeit one patient passed away from a COVID-19 unrelated cause. Interestingly, only five of these patients were ongoing treatment at the time of contracting the virus, suggesting that hospital visitation was the likely factor contributing to the elevated incidence in cancer patients. Moreover, we also observed that the incidence of severe COVID-19 was not higher than in the general population. Consequently, for cancer patients who require treatment, proper isolation protocols must be in place to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Although its basic clinical features have been reported, the dynamic characteristics of immune system in COVID-2019 patients, especially those critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, are not yet well understood. We aim to describe the dynamic characteristics of immune system in 3 critical patients with refractory hypoxemia, and discuss the relationship between hypoxemia severity and immune cell levels, and the changes of gut microbes of COVID-2019 patient. Methods This is a retrospective study from 3 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, a COVID-2019 designated hospital in Wuhan, from January 31 to February 6, 2020. All patients were diagnosed and classified based on the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China4. We recorded the epidemiological history, demographic features, clinical characteristics, symptoms and signs, treatment and clinical outcome in detail. Blood samples were collected and we determined the expression levels of immune cells (CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD16+56+ NK cells) in different time points. Nanopore Targeted Sequencing was used to determine the alterations of gut microbiota homeostasis. Results Apart from the clinical features described previously4, we found that four patients had decreased immune cells and refractory hypoxemia during the hospitalization, and the severity of hypoxemia was strongly correlated to the expression levels of immune cells. Additionally, we found that the proportion of probiotics was significantly reduced, such as Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium, and the proportion of conditioned pathogenic bacteria was significantly increased, such as Corynebacterium of Actinobacteria and Ruthenibacterium of Firmicutes. Notably, all patients died. Conclusions We discussed the dynamic characteristics of host immune system and the imbalance of gut microbiota in 3 critical patients with COVID-2019. Hypoxemia severity was closely related with host immune cell levels, and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut microbiota imbalance may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which revealing that immunodepletion with refractory hypoxemia is a potential high risk subtype of COVID-2019 and the vicious circle between immune disorder and gut dysbiosis may be a high risk of fatal pneumonia.

SARS-CoV-2 is a human-to-human pathogen that caused fever, severe respiratory disease and pneumonia (known as COVID-19). By press time, more than 70,000 infected people had been confirmed worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus broke out 17 years ago. However, it has increased transmissibility as compared with the SARS-CoV, e.g. very often infected individuals without any symptoms could still transfer the virus to others. It is thus urgent to develop a rapid, accurate and onsite diagnosis methods in order to effectively identify these early infects, treat them on time and control the disease spreading. Here we developed an isothermal LAMP based method-iLACO (isothermal LAMP based method for COVID-19) to amplify a fragment of the ORF1ab gene using 6 primers. We assured the species-specificity of iLACO by comparing the sequences of 11 related viruses by BLAST (including 7 similar coronaviruses, 2 influenza viruses and 2 normal coronaviruses). The sensitivity is comparable to Taqman based qPCR detection method, detecting synthesized RNA equivalent to 10 copies of 2019-nCoV virus. Reaction time varied from 15-40 minutes, depending on the loading of virus in the collected samples. The accuracy, simplicity and versatility of the new developed method suggests that iLACO assays can be conveniently applied with for 2019-nCoV threat control, even in those cases where specialized molecular biology equipment is not available.

The spread of this novel virus can eventually become an international emergency. During the early outbreak phase in Wuhan, one of the most important public health tasks is to prevent the spread of the virus to other cities. Therefore, full-scale border control measures to prevent the spread of virus have been discussed in many nearby countries. At the same time, lockdown in Wuhan cityu (border control from leaving out) has been imposed. The challenge is that many people have traveled from Wuhan to other cities before the border control. Thus, it is difficult to forecast the number of imported cases at different cities and estimate their risk on outbreak emergence. Here, we have developed a mathematical framework incorporating city-to-city connections to calculate the number of imported cases of the novel virus from an outbreak source, and the cumulative number of secondary cases generated by the imported cases. We used this number to estimate the arrival time of outbreak emergence using air travel frequency data from Wuhan to other cities, collected from the International Air Transport Association database. In addition, a meta-population compartmental model was built based on a classical SIR approach to simulate outbreaks at different cities. We consider the scenarios under three basic reproductive number settings using the best knowledge of the current findings, from high (2.92), mild (1.68), to a much lower numbers (1.4). The mean arrival time of outbreak spreading has been determined. Under the high , the critical time is 17.9 days after December 31, 2019 for outbreak spreading. Under the low , the critical time is between day 26.2 to day 35 after December 31, 2019. To make an extra 30 days gain, under the low (1.4), the control measures have to reduce 87% of the connections between the source and target cities. Under the higher (2.92), the effect on reducing the chance of outbreak emergence is generally low until the border control measure was enhanced to reduce more than 95% of the connections.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementWe thank for funding supports from City University of Hong Kong (#7200573 and #9610416).Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein in complex with CR3022, a neutralizing antibody previously isolated from a convalescent SARS patient. CR3022 targets a highly conserved epitope that enables cross-reactive binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Structural modeling further demonstrates that the binding site can only be accessed when at least two RBDs on the trimeric S protein are in the ″up″ conformation. Overall, this study provides structural and molecular insight into the antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yuan, Mingli</author><author>Yin, Wen</author><author>Tao, Zhaowu</author><author>Tan, Weijun</author><author>Hu, Yi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Association of radiologic findings with mortality of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.22.20024927</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.22.20024927</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Radiologic characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (NCIP) which had not been fully understood are especially important for diagnosing and predicting prognosis. We retrospective studied 27 consecutive patients who were confirmed NCIP, the clinical characteristics and CT image findings were collected, and the association of radiologic findings with mortality of patients was evaluated. 27 patients included 12 men and 15 women, with median age of 60 years (IQR 47-69). 17 patients discharged in recovered condition and 10 patients died in hospital. The median age of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (68 (IQR 63-73) vs 55 (IQR 35-60), P = 0.003). The comorbidity rate in mortality group was significantly higher than in survival group (80% vs 29%, P = 0.018). The predominant CT characteristics consisted of ground glass opacity (67%), bilateral sides involved (86%), both peripheral and central distribution (74%), and lower zone involvement (96%). The median CT score of mortality group was higher compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7-13) vs 12 (IQR 11-43), P = 0.021), with more frequency of consolidation (40% vs 6%, P = 0.047) and air bronchogram (60% vs 12%, P = 0.025). An optimal cutoff value of a CT score of 24.5 had a sensitivity of 85.6% and a specificity of 84.5% for the prediction of mortality. 2019-nCoV was more likely to infect elderly people with chronic comorbidities. CT findings of NCIP were featured by predominant ground glass opacities mixed with consolidations, mainly peripheral or combined peripheral and central distributions, bilateral and lower lung zones being mostly involved. A simple CT scoring method was capable to predict mortality.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran based on the SIR model. The results of the analysis of the epidemiological data of Iran from January 22 to March 8, 2020 were investigated and the prediction was made until March 29, 2020. Methods: By estimating the three parameters of time-dependent transmission rate, time-dependent recovery rate, and time-dependent mortality rate from Covid-19 outbreak in China, and using the number of Covid-19 infections in Iran, we predicted the number of patients for the next month in Iran. Each of these parameters was estimated using GAM models. All analyses were conducted in R software using the mgcv package. Findings: On average, 925 people with COVID-19 are expected to be infected daily in Iran. The epidemic peaks within one week (15.03.2020 to 03.21.2020) and reaches its highest point on 03.18.2020 with 1126 infected cases. Conclusion: The most important point is to emphasize the timing of the epidemic peak, hospital readiness, government measures and public readiness to reduce social contact.

At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus, termed as 2019-nCoV, has broken out and is propagating in China and the world. Here we propose a multi-model ordinary differential equation set neural network (MMODEs-NN) and model-free methods to predict the interprovincial transmissions in mainland China, especially those from Hubei Province. Compared with the previously proposed epidemiological models, the proposed network can simulate the transportations with the ODEs activation method, while the model-free methods based on the sigmoid function, Gaussian function, and Poisson distribution are linear and fast to generate reasonable predictions. According to the numerical experiments and the realities, the special policies for controlling the disease are successful in some provinces, and the transmission of the epidemic, whose outbreak time is close to the beginning of China Spring Festival travel rush, is more likely to decelerate before February 18 and to end before April 2020. The proposed mathematical and artificial intelligence methods can give consistent and reasonable predictions of the 2019-nCoV ending. We anticipate our work to be a starting point for comprehensive prediction researches of the 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zeng, Yan-Ming</author><author>Xu, Xiao-Lei</author><author>He, Xiao-Qing</author><author>Tang, Sheng-Quan</author><author>Li, Yao</author><author>Huang, Yin-Qiu</author><author>Harypursat, Vijay</author><author>Chen, Yao-Kai</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparative effectiveness and safety of ribavirin plus interferon-alpha, lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon-alpha and ribavirin plus lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon-alphain in patients with mild to moderate novel coronavirus pneumonia</title><secondary-title>Chinese Medical Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chinese Medical Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>1</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Chin Med J (Engl)</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/CM9.0000000000000790</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.lww.com/10.1097/CM9.0000000000000790</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zeng, Zehua</author><author>Zhi, Luo</author><author>Du, Hongwu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predictions for the binding domain and potential new drug targets of 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.26.961938</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.26.961938</electronic-resource-num><urls/><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>An outbreak of new SARS-like viral in Wuhan, China has been named 2019-nCoV. The current state of the epidemic is increasingly serious, and there has been the urgent necessity to develop an effective new drug. In previous studies, it was found that the conformation change in CTD1 was the region where SARS-CoV bound to human ACE2. Although there are mutations of the 2019-nCoV, the binding energy of ACE2 remains high. The surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV was coincident with the CTD1 region of the S-protein by comparing the I-TASSER prediction model with the actual SARS model, which suggests that 2019-nCoV may bind to the ACE2 receptor through conformational changes. Furthermore, site prediction on the surface glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV suggests some core amino acid area may be a novel drug target against 2019-nCoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhai, Yunkai</author><author>Wang, Yichuan</author><author>Zhang, Minhao</author><author>Gittell, Jody Hoffer</author><author>Jiang, Shuai</author><author>Chen, Baozhan</author><author>Cui, Fangfang</author><author>He, Xianying</author><author>Zhao, Jie</author><author>Wang, Xiaojun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>From Isolation to Coordination: How Can Telemedicine Help Combat the COVID-19 Outbreak?</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.20.20025957</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.20.20025957</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>The rapid spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents China with a critical challenge. As normal capacity of the Chinese hospitals is exceeded, healthcare professionals struggling to manage this unprecedented crisis face the difficult question of how best to coordinate the medical resources used in highly separated locations. Responding rapidly to this crisis, the National Telemedicine Center of China (NTCC), located in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, has established the Emergency Telemedicine Consultation System (ETCS), a telemedicine-enabled outbreak alert and response network. ETCS is built upon a doctor-to-doctor (D2D) approach, in which health services can be accessed remotely through terminals across hospitals. The system architecture of ETCS comprises three major architectural layers: (1) telemedicine service platform layer, (2) telemedicine cloud layer, and (3) telemedicine service application layer. Our ETCS has demonstrated substantial benefits in terms of the effectiveness of consultations and remote patient monitoring, multidisciplinary care, and prevention education and training.

Daily intercity migration data for 367 cities in China are collected from Baidu Migration, a mobile-app based human migration tracking data system. Historical data of infected, recovered and death cases from official source are used for model fitting. The set of model parameters obtained from best data fitting using a constrained nonlinear optimization procedure is used for estimation of the dynamics of epidemic spreading in the coming weeks. Our results show that the number of infections in most cities in China will peak between mid February to early March 2020, with about 0.8%, less than 0.1% and less than 0.01% of the population eventually infected in Wuhan, Hubei Province and the rest of China, respectively.

Based on the historical data collected for COVID-19 spreading in 367 cities in China and the set of parameters of the augmented Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model obtained for each city, a set of profile codes representing a variety of transmission mechanisms and contact topologies is formed. By comparing the data of an early outbreak of a given population with the complete set of historical profiles, the best fit profiles are selected and the corresponding sets of profile codes are used for prediction of the future progression of the epidemic in that population. Application of the method to the data collected for South Korea, Italy and Iran shows that peaks of infection cases are expected to occur before the end of March 2020, and that the percentage of population infected in each city will be less than 0.01%, 0.05% and 0.02%, for South Korea, Italy and Iran, respectively.

We reported the clinical characteristics of 82 death cases with COVID-19 in a single center. Methods Clinical data on 82 death cases laboratory-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infection were obtained from a Wuhan local hospital′s electronic medical records according to previously designed standardized data collection forms. Findings All patients were local residents of Wuhan, and the great proportion of them were diagnosed as severe illness when admitted. Most of the death cases were male (65.9%). More than half of dead patients were older than 60 years (80.5%) and the median age was 72.5 years. The bulk of death cases had comorbidity (76.8%), including hypertension (56.1%), heart disease (20.7%), diabetes (18.3%), cerebrovascular disease (12.2%), and cancer (7.3%). Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), following by sepsis syndrome/MOF (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. On the admission, lymphopenia (89.2%), neutrophilia (74.3%), and thrombocytopenia (24.3%) were usually observed. Most patients had a high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of &gt;5 (94.5%), high systemic immune-inflammation index of &gt;500 (89.2%), increased C-reactive protein level (100%), lactate dehydrogenase (93.2%), and D-dimer (97.1%). A high level of IL-6 (&gt;10 pg/ml) was observed in all detected patients. Median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days (IQR 11-20), and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p=0.037) and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed. Conclusion Older males with comorbidities are more likely to develop severe disease, even die from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Respiratory failure is the main cause of COVID-19, but either virus itself or cytokine release storm mediated damage to other organ including cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hemorrhage should be taken seriously as well.

This disease is initiated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and uncontrolled cytokine storm, but it remains unknown as to whether a robust antibody response is related to clinical deterioration and poor outcome in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies were determined by chemiluminescence analysis (CLIA) in COVID-19 patients from a single center in Wuhan. Median IgG and IgM levels in acute and convalescent-phase sera (within 35 days) for all included patients were calculated and compared among severe and nonsevere patients. Immune response phenotyping based on late IgG levels and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was characterized to stratify patients with different disease severities and outcome. Laboratory parameters in patients with different immune response phenotypes and disease severities were analyzed. Findings: A total of 222 patients were included in this study. IgG was first detected on day 4 of illness, and its peak levels occurred in the fourth week. Severe cases were more frequently found in patients with high IgG levels, compared to those who with low IgG levels (51.8% versus 32.3%; p=0.008). Severity rates for patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo, NLRloIgGhi, and NLRloIgGlo phenotype was 72.3%, 48.5%, 33.3%, and 15.6%, respectively (p&lt;0.0001). Furthermore, severe patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo had higher proinflammatory cytokines levels including IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10, and decreased CD4+ T cell count compared to those with NLRloIgGlo phenotype (p&lt;0.05). Recovery rate for severe patients with NLRhiIgGhi, NLRhiIgGlo, NLRloIgGhi, and NLRloIgGlo phenotype was 58.8% (20/34), 68.8% (11/16), 80.0% (4/5), and 100% (12/12), respectively (p=0.0592). Dead cases only occurred in NLRhiIgGhi and NLRhiIgGlo phenotypes. Interpretation: COVID-19 severity is associated with increased IgG response, and an immune response phenotyping based on late IgG response and NLR could act as a simple complementary tool to discriminate between severe and nonsevere COVID-19 patients, and further predict their clinical outcome.

Methods Python 3.7.1 was used to write a SEIR class to model the epidemic procedure and a back propagation class to estimate the initial true infected number. The epidemic area in China was divided into three parts, Wuhan city, Hubei province (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) based on the different transmission pattern. A limitation factor for the medical resource was imposed to model the infected but not quarantined. Credible data source from Baidu Qianxi were used to assess the number of infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other areas. Results Basic reproduction number, R0, was 3.6 in the very early stage. The true infected number was 4508 in our model in Wuhan before January 22, 2020. By January 22 2020, it was estimated that 1764 infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei province. Effective reproductive number, R, gradually decreased from 3.6 (Wuhan, stage 1), 3.4 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 1) and 3.3 (China except Hubei, stage 1) to 0.67 (Wuhan, stage 4), 0.83 (Hubei except Wuhan, stage 2) and 0.63 (China except Hubei, stage 2), respectively. Especially after January 23, 2020 when Wuhan City was closed, the infected number showed a turning point in Wuhan. By early April, there would be 42073, 21342 and 13384 infected cases in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) respectively, and there would be 2179, 633 and 107 death in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) respectively. Conclusion A series of control measures in China have effectively prevented the spread of COVID-19, and the epidemic will end in early April.

The clinical and epidemiological characteristics of adult patients have been revealed recently. However, the information of paediatric patients remains unclear. We describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of paediatric patients to provide valuable insight into early diagnosis of COVID-19 in children, as well as epidemic control policy making. METHODS and FINDINGS This retrospective, observational study was a case series performed at 4 hospitals in the west of China. Thirty-four paediatric patients with COVID-19 were included from January 1 to February 25, 2020. And the final follow-up visit was completed by February 28, 2020. Clinical and epidemiological characteristics were analyzed on the basis of demographic data, medical history, laboratory tests, radiological findings, and treatment information. Data analysis was performed on 34 paediatrics patients with COVID-19 aged from 1 to 144 months (median 33.00, IQR 10.00 - 94.25), among whom 14 males (41.18%) were included. 47.60% of patients were noticed without any exposure history. The median incubation period was 10.50 (7.75 - 25.25) days. Infections of other respiratory pathogens were reported in 16 patients (47.06%). The most common initial symptoms were fever (76.47%), cough (58.82%), and expectoration (20.59%). Vomiting (11.76%) and diarrhea (11.76%) were also reported in a considerable portion of cases. A remarkable increase was detected in serum amyloid A for 17 patients (85.00%) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for 17 patients (58.62%), while a decrease of prealbumin was noticed in 25 patients (78.13%). In addition, the levels of lactate dehydrogenase was increased significantly in 28 patients (82.35%), as well as α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase in 25 patients (73.53%). Patchy lesions in lobules were detected by chest computed tomographic scans in 28 patients (82.36%). The typical feature of ground-glass opacity for adults was rare in paediatric patients (2.94%). A late-onset pattern of lesions in lobules were also noticed. Stratified analysis of the clinical features were not performed due to relatively limited samples. CONCLUSIONS Our data presented the clinical and epidemiological features of paediatric patients systemically. The findings offer new insight into the early identification and intervention of paediatric patients with COVID-19.

Studying the epidemic dynamics is crucial for further surveillance and control of the outbreak. We employed a Bayesian framework to infer the time-calibrated phylogeny and the epidemic dynamics represented by the effective reproductive number (Re) changing over time from 33 genomic sequences available from GISAID. The time of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) was December 17, 2019 (95% HPD: December 7, 2019 – December 23, 2019). The median estimate of Re shifted from 1.6 to 1.1 on around January 1, 2020. This study provides an early insight of the 2019-nCoV epidemic. However, due to limited amount of data, one should be cautious when interpreting the results at this stage.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Deng-hai</author><author>Wu, Kun-lun</author><author>Zhang, Xue</author><author>Deng, Sheng-qiong</author><author>Peng, Bin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In silico screening of Chinese herbal medicines with the potential to directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus</title><secondary-title>Journal of Integrative Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Integrative Medicine</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>J Integr Med</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.joim.2020.02.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2095496420300157</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Feng</author><author>Zhang, Jinmei</author><author>Cao, Menglan</author><author>Hui, Cang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A simple ecological model captures the transmission pattern of the coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak in China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.27.20028928</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.27.20028928</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>The rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), initially reported in the city of Wuhan in China, and quickly transmitted to the entire nation and beyond, has become an international public health emergency. Estimating the final number of infection cases and the turning point (time with the fastest spreading rate) is crucial to assessing and improving the national and international control measures currently being applied. In this paper we develop a simple model based on infectious growth with a time-varying infection rate, and estimate the final number of infections and the turning point using data updated daily from 3 February 2020, when China escalated its initial public health measures, to 10 February. Our model provides an extremely good fit to the existing data and therefore a reasonable estimate of the time-varying infection rate that has largely captured the transmission pattern of this epidemic outbreak. Our estimation suggests that (i) the final number of infections in China could reach 78,000 with an upper 95% confidence limit of 88,880; (ii) the turning point of the fastest spread was on the 4th or the 5th of February; and (iii) the projected period for the end of the outbreak (i.e., when 95% of the final predicted number of infection is reached) will be the 24th of February, with an upper 95% confidence limit on the 19th of March. This suggests that the current control measures in China are excellent, and more than sufficient to contain the spread of this highly infectious novel coronavirus, and that the application of such measures could be considered internationally for the global control of this outbreak. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement FZ is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.31360104) and Anhui University (S020118002/101); CH is supported by the National Research Foundation of South Africa (grant 89967). ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Materials and Methods: An anonymous online questionnaire survey was conducted in 17 pediatric nephropathy diagnosis and treatment centers in China. The questions collected basic information on the patients and their parents and data on changes in the approach to medical treatment and their needs in the context of the outbreak etc. This is a Multicenter Cross-section Study. Results: A total of 735 valid questionnaires were collected. 555 patients (75.5%) and their parents said that the outbreak had a significant influence on their medical treatment: 264 patients (47.6%) said that it would be delayed by 2 to 4 weeks and 199 patients (35.9%) by 4 to 8 weeks. 510 patients (84.16%) hoped to get in touch with specialists through online consultation, and 528 patients (84.5%) hoped that online consultation could be implemented and that medication could be delivered to them.. A total of 458 patients (62.3%) said that their greatest concern was that the CKD would be aggravated or that they would experience a relapse; only 203 patients were infected by 2019-nCoV. A total of 313 patients (42.5%) experienced anxiety and thus required the intervention of psychologists. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the medical treatment of children with CKD. Online consultation, medication delivery and psychological counselling are the greatest needs reported by patients and their families and could especially provide solutions for the management of low income children with CKD in remote rural areas in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Clinical Trial ChiCTR1800019795 ### Funding Statement This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

More data were needed to understand the clinical characteristics of the disease. Objectives: To study the epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods: we performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital. Measurements and Main Results: The median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications. As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic spreads rapidly by human-to-human transmission. Patients with elder age, chronic comorbidities, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, co-infection and severe complications might increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes.

The same as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 2019-nCov enters into host cells via cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). In order to dissect the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion and explore a potential route of the 2019-nCov infection in digestive system infection, 4 datasets with single-cell transcriptomes of lung, esophagus, gastric, ileum and colon were analyzed. The data showed that ACE2 was not only highly expressed in the lung AT2 cells, esophagus upper and stratified epithelial cells but also in absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon. These results indicated along with respiratory systems, digestive system is a potential routes for 2019-nCov infection. In conclusion, this study has provided the bioinformatics evidence of the potential route for infection of 2019-nCov in digestive system along with respiratory tract and may have significant impact for our healthy policy setting regards to prevention of 2019-nCoV infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Huimin</author><author>Wang, Wei</author><author>Wu, Ningjun</author><author>Liu, Wugao</author><author>Qu, Chunsheng</author><author>Jia, Xu</author><author>Su, Chang</author><author>Wang, Jingke</author><author>Feng, Youjun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influenza-Like Illness Caused by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) via the Person-to-Person Transmission</title><secondary-title>Preprints (www.preprints.org)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Preprints (www.preprints.org)</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>2019-nCoV</keyword><keyword>influenza-like illness</keyword><keyword>person-to-person transmission</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Preprints</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.20944/PREPRINTS202003.0160.V1</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Jin‐jin</author><author>Dong, Xiang</author><author>Cao, Yi‐Yuan</author><author>Yuan, Ya‐dong</author><author>Yang, Yi‐bin</author><author>Yan, You‐qin</author><author>Akdis, Cezmi A.</author><author>Gao, Ya‐dong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical characteristics of 140 patients infected by SARS‐CoV‐2 in Wuhan, China</title><secondary-title>Allergy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Allergy</full-title></periodical><pages>all.14238</pages><keywords><keyword>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus‐2</keyword><keyword>allergy</keyword><keyword>coronavirus disease 2019</keyword><keyword>eosinophil</keyword><keyword>risk factor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/all.14238</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/all.14238</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Jin</author><author>Liu, Jianhua</author><author>Li, Na</author><author>Liu, Yong</author><author>Ye, Rui</author><author>Qin, Xiaosong</author><author>Zheng, Rui</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Serological detection of 2019-nCoV respond to the epidemic: A useful complement to nucleic acid testing</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.04.20030916</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.04.20030916</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Zhang et al. - 2020 - Serological detection of 2019-nCoV respond to the epidemic A useful complement to nucleic acid testing.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly to more than 70 countries and regions overseas and over 80000 cases have been infected, resulting in more than three thousand deaths. Rapid diagnosis of patients remains a bottleneck in containing the progress of the epidemic. We used automated chemiluminescent immunoassay to detect serum IgM and IgG antibodies to 2019-nCoV of 736 subjects. COVID-19 patients were becoming reactive(positive) for specific antibodies from 7-12 days after the onset of morbidity. Specific IgM and IgG increased with the progression of the disease. The areas under the ROC curves of IgM and IgG were 0.988 and 1.000, respectively. Specific antibody detection has good sensitivity and specificity. Detection of specific antibodies in patients with fever can be a good distinction between COVID-19 and other diseases, so as to be a complement to nucleic acid diagnosis to early diagnosis of suspected cases. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This study was funded by “the National Science and Technology Major Project of China (2018ZX10302205)”, “Liaoning Province Natural Science Foundation Project(20180550523)”, “Liaoning Province Central Government's special project to guide local scientific and technological development (2019JH6/10400009)”, “Guangdong Province Major key projects of industrial technology (201902010003)”, “Major Special Project of Construction Program of China Medical University in 2018(112/3110118034)” and “345 talent project” of Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University.

Understanding the fast evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. Methods We collected individual information on 8,579 laboratory-confirmed cases from official publically sources reported outside Hubei in mainland China, as of February 17, 2020. We estimated the temporal variation of the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. Results The median age of the cases was 44 years, with an increasing of cases in younger age groups and the elderly as the epidemic progressed. The delay from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4.4 days (95%CI: 0.0-14.0) until January 27 to 2.6 days (0.0-9.0) from January 28 to February 17. The mean incubation period was estimated at 5.2 days (1.8-12.4) and the mean serial interval at 5.1 days (1.3-11.6). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei was highly variable, but consistently included a mix of case importations and local transmission. We estimate that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than three weeks with Rt reaching peaks between 1.40 (1.04-1.85) in Shenzhen City of Guangdong Province and 2.17 (1.69-2.76) in Shandong Province. In all the analyzed locations (n=10) Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold since the end of January. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the strict containment measures and movement restrictions in place may contribute to the interruption of local COVID-19 transmission outside Hubei Province. The shorter serial interval estimated here implies that transmissibility is not as high as initial estimates suggested. ### Competing Interest Statement B.J.C. has received honoraria from Roche and Sanofi Pasteur.

No specific treatment for this infection is currently available. We previously reported that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic which has routinely been used in the clinic to treat bacterial infection with low toxicity, significantly inhibits the invasion of cells by Ebola virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, via specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L. Here, we tested the efficacy of teicoplanin against 2019-nCoV virus infection and found that teicoplanin potently prevents the entrance of 2019-nCoV-Spike-pseudoviruses into the cytoplasm, with an IC50 of 1.66 μM. Although the inhibitory effect upon the replication of wildtype viruses ex vivo and in vivo remains to be determined, our preliminary result indicates that the potential antiviral activity of teicoplanin could be applied for the treatment of 2019-nCoV virus infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Junyi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Testing Case Number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China with Newcomb-Benford Law</title><secondary-title>arXiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>arXiv</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05695</url></web-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>The coronavirus disease 2019 bursted out about two months ago in Wuhan has caused the death of more than a thousand people.

As the disease continues to spread, the biomedical society urgently began identifying effective approaches to prevent further outbreaks. Through rigorous epidemiological analysis, we characterized the fast transmission of COVID-19 with a basic reproductive number 5.6 and proved a sole zoonotic source to originate in Wuhan. No changes in transmission have been noted across generations. By evaluating different control strategies through predictive modeling and Monte carlo simulations, a comprehensive quarantine in hospitals and quarantine stations has been found to be the most effective approach. Government action to immediately enforce this quarantine is highly recommended.

In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable. This article is protected by copyright.

By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37,914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. The optimal parameters were estimated as R0=1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47)，TI=14 (interquartile range: 14-14) and TE=3.0 (interquartile range: 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 45,000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200,000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March.

Type II strains were likely evolved from Type I and are more prevalent than Type I among infected patients (68 Type II strains vs 29 Type I strains in total). Our results suggest the outbreak of type II COVID-19 likely occurred in the Huanan market, while the initial transmission of the type I virus to humans probably occurred at a different location in Wuhan. Second, by analyzing the three genomic sites distinguishing Type I and Type II strains, we found that the synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II straints are more prevalent, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I. These findings could be valuable for the current epidemic prevention and control. The timely sharing of our findings would benefit the public health officials in making policies, diagnosis and treatments.

Methods The information of NCIP and 2003-SARS from websites of NHCPRC and the World Health Organization was collected, and then the transmission dynamics of the two kinds of infectious diseases were analyzed. The information of 287 confirmed NCIP patients obtained from the website of health committees of 16 provinces. A descriptive epidemiological analysis method was employed to carefully analyze the epidemic characteristics. Subsequently, the NCIP epidemic data in Wuhan and other inland regions of China was analyzed separately and compared. A multivariate function model was constructed based on the confirmed NCIP case data. Results The growth rate of new cases and deaths of NCIP were significantly faster than those of 2003-SARS. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and other inland areas both showed increasing trends. 287 confirmed NCIP cases aged 9 months to 90 years and the average age was (42.38 ±15.97) years. The gender ratio (M: F) was 1.35: 1. The numbers of NCIP patients in Wuhan and other inland areas were in line with Y=0.7209 x3-11.97x2+59.129x (R2=0.9858) and Y=2.2169 x3-39.74x2+158.88x (R2=0.9357)，respectively, with good fitting effects judging by their R2 values. Conclusions The fatality rate of NCIP is lower than that of 2003-SARS and the cure rate is higher. The age of NCIP patients is mainly concentrated in the 30-50 years old (68.29%). The harm of the first-generation NCIP patients is indeed higher than that of secondary cases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe present study was funded by Research Project from Health Commission of Shaanxi Provincial Government (2018A017), Research Project from Education Department of Shaanxi Provincial Government (19JS015), Subject Innovation Team of Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine (132041933).Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

The epidemiological reports now focus on the confirmed COVID-19 cases, and we aim to assess the health and wellbeing of normal adults living and working after one month of public health emergencies into the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Methods One month into the outbreak, on Feb 20/21, 2020, we sampled 369 adults on the eight dimensions of health (SF12), distress (K6), and life satisfaction in 64 cities that varied in their densities of coronavirus confirmed cases. The participants also reported their work status, whether they had chronic health issues, the number of hours they exercised per day in the past week. Findings In general, life of normal adults was severely disrupted. 33% of the participants had not left their home at all during the one-month period due to the restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 in China. 27% of the participants worked at office; 38% resorted to working from home; and 25% suspended working due to the outbreak. Those who suspended working reported worse health conditions by SF12 as well as distress (K6). The severity of the COVID-19 in individuals location predicts their life satisfaction, and this relationship is moderated by the existing chronic health issues and exercising hour of each individual. Interpretation Our findings support the need to pay attention to the health of people who were not affected by the virus epistemologically. We need to support especially people who suspended working during the outbreak. Our results also highlight that people who are usually active, as indicated by more exercises, might be more suspectable to wellbeing issues due to the lockdown. Policymakers who are thinking of introducing measures to contain COVID-19 may benefit from understanding such health and welling implications.

The model included major parameters as transmission strength and its decline parameters, mean incubation period, hospitalization time, non-hospitalization daily mortality, non-hospitalization daily recovery rate, and hospitalization proportion, etc. Sensitivity analysis of the model indicated the total cumulative cases significantly increased with initial transmission strength, hospitalization time. The total cumulative cases significantly decreased with decline of transmission strength and hospitalization proportion, and linearly decreased with non-hospitalization daily mortality and non-hospitalization daily recovery rate. In a certain range, the total cumulative cases significantly increased with mean incubation period. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that dynamic change of transmission strength is one of the most important and controllable factors. In addition, reducing the delay for hospitalization is much effective in weakening disease epidemic. Non-hospitalization recovery rate is of importance for enhancing immunity to recover from the disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Yinhua</author><author>Odiwuor, Nelson</author><author>Xiong, Jin</author><author>Sun, Luo</author><author>Nyaruaba, Raphael Ohuru</author><author>Wei, Hongping</author><author>Tanner, Nathan A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rapid Molecular Detection of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Virus RNA Using Colorimetric LAMP</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.26.20028373</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.26.20028373</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>The ability to detect an infectious agent in a widespread epidemic is crucial to the success of quarantine efforts in addition to sensitive and accurate screening of potential cases of infection from patients in a clinical setting. Enabling testing outside of sophisticated laboratories broadens the scope of control and surveillance efforts, but also requires robust and simple methods that can be used without expensive instrumentation. Here we report a method to identify SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus RNA from purified RNA or cell lysis using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using a visual, colorimetric detection. This test was additionally verified using RNA samples purified from respiratory swabs collected from COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China with equivalent performance to a commercial RT-qPCR test while requiring only heating and visual inspection. This simple and sensitive method provides an opportunity to facilitate virus detection in the field without a requirement for complex diagnostic infrastructure.

A good understanding of the dynamic of the disease would greatly enhance the control and prevention of COVID-19. However, to the best of our knowledge, the unique features of the outbreak have limited the applications of all existing models. In this paper, a novel stochastic model is proposed which aims to account for the unique transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and capture the effects of intervention measures implemented in Mainland China. We find that, (1) instead of aberration, there is a remarkable amount of asymptomatic individuals, (2) an individual with symptoms is approximately twice more likely to pass the disease to others than that of an asymptomatic patient, (3) the transmission rate has reduced significantly since the implementation of control measures in Mainland China, (4) it is expected that the epidemic outbreak would be contained by early March in the the selected provinces and cities.

We developed data-driven susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-recovered (SEIQR) models to simulate the epidemic with the interventions of social distancing and epicenter lockdown. Population migration data combined with officially reported data were used to estimate model parameters, and then calculated the daily exported infected individuals by estimating the daily infected ratio and daily susceptible population size. As of Jan 01, 2020, the estimated initial number of latently infected individuals was 380.1 (95%-CI: 379.8~381.0). With 30 days of substantial social distancing, the reproductive number in Wuhan and Hubei was reduced from 2.2 (95%-CI: 1.4~3.9) to 1.58 (95%-CI: 1.34~2.07), and in other provinces from 2.56 (95%-CI: 2.43~2.63) to 1.65 (95%-CI: 1.56~1.76). We found that earlier intervention of social distancing could significantly limit the epidemic in mainland China. The number of infections could be reduced up to 98.9%, and the number of deaths could be reduced by up to 99.3% as of Feb 23, 2020. However, earlier epicenter lockdown would partially neutralize this favorable effect. Because it would cause in situ deteriorating, which overwhelms the improvement out of the epicenter. To minimize the epidemic size and death, stepwise implementation of social distancing in the epicenter city first, then in the province, and later the whole nation without the epicenter lockdown would be practical and cost-effective.

Pangolin-CoV is 91.02% and 90.55% identical at the whole genome level to 2019-nCoV and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively. Pangolin-CoV is the lowest common ancestor of 2019-nCoV and RaTG13. The S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is much more closely related to 2019-nCoV than RaTG13. Five key amino-acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and 2019-nCoV but four amino-acid mutations occur in RaTG13.

It is highly demanding to estimate how many COVID-19 patients will die eventually. In this study, an estimate of the potential total number of COVID-19 deaths in mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other provinces is provided. The results may help to eluate the severity of the epidemic and facilitate mental health care. Methods: Data of the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths from January 21 to February 29, 2020, released daily by the National Health Commission of China and Hubei Provincial Health Commission, were used. The Boltzmann function was explored to simulate the data in each region. By using these established functions, the potential total number of deaths were forecasted. In addition, data of the cumulative number of 2003 SARS deaths in mainland China, Hong Kong and worldwide were collected from the WHO official website and analyzed in a similar manner. A Monte Carlo technique was applied to analyze the uncertainty of the estimates of the cumulative confirmed cases, and the results are presented using the resulting mean, median, and a 95% confidence interval (CI). For comparison, the potential total numbers of deaths were estimated by Richards function-based regression analyses. Findings: The data of cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths with respect to each region were all well-fitted to the Boltzmann function (R2 for all the regression analyses being close to 0.999). Consistently, the data for the cumulative numbers of 2003 SARS in mainland China, Hong Kong and worldwide were also well fitted to the Boltzmann function. The potential total number of COVID-19 deaths in mainland China, other provinces, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other cities in Hubei were estimated to be 3260 (95% CI 3187, 3394), 110 (109, 112), 3174 (3095, 3270), 2550 (2494, 2621) and 617 (607, 632), respectively. Similar results were obtained by Richards function-based regression analysis. Interpretation: The observation that the data of the cumulative numbers of deaths for both the on-going COVID-19 outbreak and the 2003 SARS epidemic in each geographic region were well fitted with the Boltzmann function strongly suggests that it is suitable for the simulation of deaths associated with coronaviruses-induced diseases. The estimation of COVID-19 deaths may help governments to evaluate the severity of the outbreak and also facilitate timely mental health care for the families of dead patients.

Meanwhile, NCP rapidly spread from China to other countries, and several countries' government rush to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan. We analyzed the infection rate of the evacuees and extrapolated the results in Wuhan's NCP incidence estimation. Methods: We collected the total number and confirmed cases of 2019-nCov infection in the evacuation of Korea, Japan, Germany, Singapore, and France and estimated the infection rate of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) among people who were evacuated from Wuhan with a meta-analysis. NCP incidence of Wuhan was indirectly estimated based on data of evacuation. Results: From Jan 29 to Feb 2, 2020, 1916 people have been evacuated from Wuhan, among them 17 have been confirmed 2019-nCov infected. The infection rate is estimated to be 1.1% (95% CI 0.4%-3.1%) using one group meta-analysis method with random effect model. We then estimated that almost 110,000 (95% CI: 40,000-310,000) people were infected with 2019-nCov in Wuhan around Feb 2, 2020, assuming the infection risk of evacuees is close to Chinese citizens in Wuhan. Conclusions: At the beginning of the outbreak, incidence of NCP may be vastly underestimated. Our result emphasizes that 2019-nCov has proposed a huge public health threats in Wuhan. We need to respond more rapidly, take large-scale public health interventions and draconian measures to limiting population mobility and control the epidemic.

DESIGN The study was conducted by comparing the blood group distribution in 2,173 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 test from three hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China with that in normal people from the corresponding regions. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and 2-tailed χ2 and a meta-analysis was performed by random effects models. SETTING Three tertiary hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China. PARTICIPANTS A total of 1,775 patients with COVID-19, including 206 dead cases, from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan, China were recruited. Another 113 and 285 patients with COVID-19 were respectively recruited from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan and Shenzhen Third People's Hospital, Shenzhen, China. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Detection of ABO blood groups, infection occurrence of SARS-CoV-2, and patient death RESULTS The ABO group in 3694 normal people in Wuhan showed a distribution of 32.16%, 24.90%, 9.10% and 33.84% for A, B, AB and O, respectively, versus the distribution of 37.75%, 26.42%, 10.03% and 25.80% for A, B, AB and O, respectively, in 1775 COVID-19 patients from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. The proportion of blood group A and O in COVID-19 patients were significantly higher and lower, respectively, than that in normal people (both P &lt; 0.001). Similar ABO distribution pattern was observed in 398 patients from another two hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen. Meta-analyses on the pooled data showed that blood group A had a significantly higher risk for COVID-19 (odds ratio-OR, 1.20; 95% confidence interval-CI 1.02~1.43, P = 0.02) compared with non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O had a significantly lower risk for the infectious disease (OR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.60~0.75, P &lt; 0.001) compared with non-O blood groups.In addition, the influence of age and gender on the ABO blood group distribution in patients with COVID-19 from two Wuhan hospitals (1,888 patients) were analyzed and found that age and gender do not have much effect on the distribution. CONCLUSION People with blood group A have a significantly higher risk for acquiring COVID-19 compared with non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O has a significantly lower risk for the infection compared with non-O blood groups.

The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. Methods A total of 173 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n = 535) collected during the hospitalization period were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using immunoassays. The dynamics of antibodies with the progress and severity of disease was analyzed. Findings Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1% (161/173), 82.7% (143/173) and 64.7% (112/173), respectively. Twelve patients who had not seroconverted were those only blood samples at the early stage of illness were collected. The seroconversion sequentially appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively. The presence of antibodies was &lt; 40% among patients in the first 7 days of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8% for Ab, IgM and IgG respectively since day 15 after onset. In contrast, the positive rate of RNA decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15 to 39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 patients (p &lt; 0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p = 0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p = 0.006). Interpretation The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.

We model the transmission process on the ship with a stochastic model and estimate the basic reproduction number at 2.2 (95%CI: 2.1−2.4). We estimate a large dispersion parameter than other coronaviruses, which implies that the virus is difficult to go extinction. The epidemic doubling time is at 4.6 days (95%CI: 3.0−9.3), and thus timely actions were crucial. The lesson learnt on the ship is generally applicable in other settings. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement DH was supported by General Research Fund (Grant Number 15205119) of the Research Grants Council (RGC) of Hong Kong, China.

Based on the publicly available surveillance data, we identified 21 transmission chains in Hong Kong and estimated the serial interval (SI) of COVID-19. Methods: Index cases were identified and reported after symptoms onset, and contact tracing was conducted to collect the data of the associated secondary cases. An interval censored likelihood framework is adopted to fit a Gamma distribution function to govern the SI of COVID-19. Findings: Assuming a Gamma distributed model, we estimated the mean of SI at 4.4 days (95%CI: 2.9−6.7) and SD of SI at 3.0 days (95%CI: 1.8−5.8) by using the information of all 21 transmission chains in Hong Kong. Conclusion: The SI of COVID-19 may be shorter than the preliminary estimates in previous works. Given the likelihood that SI could be shorter than the incubation period, pre-symptomatic transmission may occur, and extra efforts on timely contact tracing and quarantine are recommended in combating the COVID-19 outbreak.

COVID-19 has multiple characteristics distinct from other infectious diseases, including a high infectivity during incubation, time delay between real dynamics and daily observed case numbers, and the effects from multiple quarantine and control measures. We develop a model SUQC to adequately characterizes the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly model the control by artificial measures, which is more suitable for analysis than other existing epidemic models. The SUQC model is applied to the daily released data of the confirmed infected to analyze the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, Hubei (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities of China. We find that, before January 30, 2020, all these regions except Beijing have a reproductive number R&gt;1, and after January 30, all regions have a reproductive number R&lt;1, indicating the effectiveness of the quarantine and control measures in inhibiting COVID-19. The confirmation rate of Wuhan is 0.0643, significantly lower than 0.1914 of Hubei (excluding Wuhan) and 0.2189 of China (excluding Hubei), but increases to 0.3229 after Feb 12th when clinical diagnosis was adopted. The un-quarantined infected individuals in Wuhan on February 12, 2020 is as high as 3,509 and decreases to 334 on February 21th, 2020. After fitting the model with recent data, we predict that the end times of COVID-19 of Wuhan and Hubei are around late-March, of China (excluding Hubei) around mid-March, and of the four tier-one cities before March 2020. A total of 80,511 individuals of the whole country are infected, among which 49,510 are from Wuhan, 17,679 from Hubei(excluding Wuhan), and the rest 13,322 from other regions of China (excluding Hubei). We suggest the rigorous quarantine and control measures should be kept before March in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, and before late-March in Hubei. The model can also be useful to predict the trend of epidemic and provide quantitative guide for other counties in a high risk of outbreak, such as South Korea, Japan and Iran. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31571370, 91631106, and 91731302), the &quot;Strategic Priority Research Program&quot; of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDB13000000), the National Key R\&amp;D Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFC1406902), and the One Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

The increasing number of cases of confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China is striking. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between chest CT findings and the clinical conditions of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease. CONCLUSION. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation of the severity and extent of disease. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion. Lesions are more likely to have peripheral distribution and bilateral involvement and be lower lung predominant and multifocal. CT involvement score can help in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhao, Xianxian</author><author>Zhang, Bili</author><author>Li, Pan</author><author>Ma, Chaoqun</author><author>Gu, Jiawei</author><author>Hou, Pan</author><author>Guo, Zhifu</author><author>Wu, Hong</author><author>Bai, Yuan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Incidence, clinical characteristics and prognostic factor of patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.17.20037572</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.17.20037572</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: Recently, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in Wuhan, China. Although the clinical features of COVID-19 have been reported previously, data regarding the risk factors associated with the clinical outcomes are lacking. Objectives: To summary and analyze the clinical characteristics and identify the predictors of disease severity and mortality. Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, Cochrane and MedRxiv databases were searched through February 25, 2020. Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) recommendations were followed. We extracted and pooled data using random-effects meta-analysis to summary the clinical feature of the confirmed COVID-19 patients, and further identify risk factors for disease severity and death. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I2 method and explained with subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Results: A total of 30 studies including 53000 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study, the mean age was 49.8 years (95% CI, 47.5-52.2 yrs) and 55.5% were male. The pooled incidence of severity and mortality were 20.2% (95% CI, 15.1-25.2%) and 3.1% (95% CI, 1.9-4.2%), respectively. The predictor for disease severity included old age (≥ 50 yrs, odds ratio [OR] = 2.61; 95% CI, 2.29-2.98), male (OR =1.348, 95% CI, 1.195-1.521), smoking (OR =1.734, 95% CI, 1.146-2.626) and any comorbidity (OR = 2.635, 95% CI, 2.098-3.309), especially chronic kidney disease (CKD, OR = 6.017; 95% CI, 2.192-16.514), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, OR = 5.323; 95% CI, 2.613-10.847) and cerebrovascular disease (OR = 3.219; 95% CI, 1.486-6.972). In terms of laboratory results, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer and decreased blood platelet and lymphocytes count were highly associated with severe COVID-19 (all for P &lt; 0.001). Meanwhile, old age (≥ 60 yrs, RR = 9.45; 95% CI, 8.09-11.04), followed by cardiovascular disease (RR = 6.75; 95% CI, 5.40-8.43) hypertension (RR = 4.48; 95% CI, 3.69-5.45) and diabetes (RR = 4.43; 95% CI, 3.49-5.61) were found to be independent prognostic factors for the COVID-19 related death. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first evidence-based medicine research to explore the risk factors of prognosis in patients with COVID-19, which is helpful to identify early-stage patients with poor prognosis and adapt effective treatment.

The new virus has spread to at least 316 cities (until 1st February 2020) in China. We used the traffic flow data from Baidu Map, and number of air passengers who left Wuhan from 1st January to 26th January, to quantify the potential infectious people. We developed multiple linear models with local population and air passengers as predicted variables to explain the variance of confirmed cases in every city across China. We found the contribution of air passengers from Wuhan was decreasing gradually, but the effect of local population was increasing, indicating the trend of local transmission. However, the increase of local transmission is slow during the early stage of novel coronavirus, due to the super strict control measures carried out by government agents and communities.

We reviewed the characteristics of interventional trials from Chinese Clinical Trial Registration (ChiCTR) and ClinicalTrials.gov. A total of 171 COVID-19-related interventional trials were identified on Feb 22nd, 2020. These trials are classified into 4 categories based on treatment modalities, including chemical drugs, biological therapies, traditional Chinese medicine treatments and other therapies. Our analysis focused on the issues of stage, design, randomization, blinding, primary endpoints definition and sample size of these trials. We found some studies with potential defects including unreasonable design, inappropriate primary endpoint definition, insufficient sample size and ethical issue. Clinical trials on COVID-19 should be designed based on scientific rules, ethics and benefits for patients.

This new coronavirus has resulted in thousands of cases of lethal disease in China, with additional patients being identified in a rapidly growing number internationally. 2019-nCov was reported to share the same receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with SARS-Cov. Here based on the public database and the state-of-the-art single-cell RNA-Seq technique, we analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile in the normal human lungs. The result indicates that the ACE2 virus receptor expression is concentrated in a small population of type II alveolar cells (AT2). Surprisingly, we found that this population of ACE2-expressing AT2 also highly expressed many other genes that positively regulating viral reproduction and transmission. A comparison between eight individual samples demonstrated that the Asian male one has an extremely large number of ACE2-expressing cells in the lung. This study provides a biological background for the epidemic investigation of the 2019-nCov infection disease, and could be informative for future anti-ACE2 therapeutic strategy development.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhao, Zeyu</author><author>Zhu, Yuan-Zhao</author><author>Xu, Jing-Wen</author><author>Hu, Qing-Qing</author><author>Lei, Zhao</author><author>Rui, Jia</author><author>Liu, Xingchun</author><author>Wang, Yao</author><author>Luo, Li</author><author>Yu, Shan-Shan</author><author>Li, Jia</author><author>Liu, Ruo-Yun</author><author>Xie, Fang</author><author>Su, Ying-Ying</author><author>Chiang, Yi-Chen</author><author>Su, Yanhua</author><author>Zhao, Benhua</author><author>Chen, Tianmu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A mathematical model for estimating the age-specific transmissibility of a novel coronavirus</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.05.20031849</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.05.20031849</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: A novel coronavirus named as &quot;SARS-CoV-2&quot; has spread widely in many countries since December 2019, especially in China. This study aimed to quantify the age-specific transmissibility by using a mathematical model. Methods: An age-specific susceptible - exposed - symptomatic - asymptomatic - recovered - seafood market (SEIARW) model was developed based on two suspected transmission routes (from market to person and person to person). The susceptible people from Wuhan City were divided into different age groups. We used the subscript i and j to represent age group 1 to 4 (1: &lt;= 14 years; 2: 15-44 years; 3: 45-64 years; 4: &gt;= 65 years) and 1 to 5 (1: &lt;= 5 years; 2: 6-14 years; 3: 15-24 years; 4: 25-59 years; 4: &gt;= 60 years), respectively. Data of reported COVID-19 cases were collected from one published literature from 26 November to 22 December, 2019 in Wuhan City, China. The age-specific transmissibility of the virus was estimated accordingly secondary attack rate (SAR). Results: The age-specific SEIARW model fitted with the reported data well by dividing the population into four age groups (χ2 = 4.99 × 10-6, P &gt; 0.999), and five age groups (χ2 = 4.85 × 10-6, P &gt; 0.999). Based on the four-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 2 to 3 (SAR23 = 17.56 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 3 to 2 (SAR32 = 10.17 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 1 to 2 (SAR12 = 0.002 per 10 million persons). Based on the five-age-group SEIARW model, the highest transmissibility occurred from age group 4 to 5 (SAR45 = 12.40 per 10 million persons), followed by from age group 5 to 4 (SAR54 = 6.61 per 10 million persons). The lowest transmissibility occurred from age group 3 to 4 (SAR34 = 0.0002 per 10 million persons). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 has high transmissibility among adults and elder people but low transmissibility among children and young people.

Although RT-PCR-based molecular diagnosis techniques are being widely applied for clinical diagnosis currently, timely and accurate diagnosis are still limited due to labour intensive and time-consuming operations of these techniques. To address the issue, herein we report the synthesis of poly (amino ester) with carboxyl groups (PC)-coated magnetic nanoparticles (pcMNPs), and the development of pcMNPs-based viral RNA extraction method for the sensitive detection of COVID-19 causing virus, the SARS-CoV-2. This method combines the lysis and binding steps into one step, and the pcMNPs-RNA complexes can be directly introduced into subsequent RT-PCR reactions. The simplified process can purify viral RNA from multiple samples within 20 min using a simple manual method or an automated high-throughput approach. By identifying two different regions (ORFlab and N gene) of viral RNA, a 10-copy sensitivity and a strong linear correlation between 10 and 100,000 copies of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles are achieved. Benefitting from the simplicity and excellent performances, this new extraction method can dramatically reduce the turn-around time and operational requirements in current molecular diagnosis of COVID-19, in particular for the early clinical diagnosis.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhao, Zonghao</author><author>Xie, Jiajia</author><author>Yin, Ming</author><author>Yang, Yun</author><author>He, Hongliang</author><author>Jin, Tengchuan</author><author>Li, Wenting</author><author>Zhu, Xiaowu</author><author>Xu, Jing</author><author>Zhao, Changcheng</author><author>Li, Lei</author><author>Li, Yi</author><author>Mengist, Hylemariam Mihiretie</author><author>Zahid, Ayesha</author><author>Yao, Ziqin</author><author>Ding, Chengchao</author><author>Qi, Yingjie</author><author>Gao, Yong</author><author>Ma, Xiaoling</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Clinical and Laboratory Profiles of 75 Hospitalized Patients with Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Hefei, China</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.01.20029785</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.01.20029785</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection began in December 2019 in Wuhan, and rapidly spread to many provinces in China. The number of cases has increased markedly in Anhui, but information on the clinical characteristics of patients is limited. We reported 75 patients with COVID-19 in the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC from Jan 21 to Feb 16, 2020, Hefei, Anhui Province, China. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR of respiratory nasopharyngeal swab samples. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Of the 75 patients with COVID-19, 61 (81.33%) had a direct or indirect exposure history to Wuhan. Common symptoms at onset included fever (66 [88.0%] of 75 patients) and dry cough (62 [82.67%]). Of the patients without fever, cough could be the only or primary symptom. The most prominent laboratory abnormalities were lymphopenia, decreased percentage of lymphocytes (LYM%), decreased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Patients with elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) showed significant decreases in the LYM%, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts. Besides, the percentage of neutrophils, CRP, LDH and Procalcitonin levels increased significantly. We concluded that COVID-19 could cause different degrees of hematological abnormalities and damage of internal organs. Hematological profiles including LYM, LDH, CRP and IL-6 could be indicators of diseases severity and evaluation of treatment effectiveness. Antiviral treatment requires a comprehensive and supportive approach. Further targeted therapy should be determined based on individual clinical manifestations and laboratory indicators.

Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the seed cases from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054\*x1+2.3455\*x2 (n = 44, R2 = 0.9330, P&lt;10-7). Even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by February 27 in non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% - 48.59%. Although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland. The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, the international community should learn from lessons of Wuhan and experience from China. Efforts of 29 Provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities against COVID-19 were also assessed preliminarily according to the interpretive model. Big data has played and will continue playing an important role in public health.

This virus shows unusually high transmission rate and unique clinical characteristics, with key pathological mechanism remaining unclear. Here, we analysed the laboratory data based on clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, in parallel comparison with non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases, in an attempt to elucidate the key pathological features of COVID-19 during its infection of the human body. Methods: We analysed biochemical indices and lymphocyte subpopulation distribution in the samples of COVID-19 infected patients, and compare the data with those from the pneumonia cases not caused by COVID-19. The study enrolled 125 patients, comprising 103 COVID-19-infected patients and 22 non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases. Laboratory findings were extracted from electronic medical records. Blood was collected for lymphocyte subsets and cytokines determination by flow cytometry analysis. The differences in biochemical indices and lymphocyte subsets distribution between COVID-19-infected and non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients were analyzed. Correlation analysis was performed between leukocyte subgroups count and biochemical indexes relating to organ injury in COVID-19 infected patients (exclude asymptomatic infected cases). Results: We observed significant differences, including abnormal biochemical indices (CRP, LDH, AST, eGFR and sodium ion concentration) and reduced lymphocyte subsets count, between the COVID-19-infected and non-COVID-19-caused pneumonia cases. Correlation analysis indicates that the count for lymphocyte subsets-but not that for neutrophils and monocytes-exhibits a significant negative correlation with biochemical indices relating to organ injury, in the COVID-19 infected patients. Conclusions: The present study indicates significantly different clinical features between COVID-19-caused and non-COVID-19-caused pneumonia, especially in terms of lymphocytopenia and organ injury. Notably, correlation analysis demonstrates that tissue damage in COVID-19 patients is attributed to virus infection itself rather than uncontrolled inflammatory responses (&quot;cytokine storm&quot;). These findings provide new insights for developing efficient therapeutic strategies against COVID-19 infection.

While genetically distinct from SARS-CoV, the etiological agent that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, both coronaviruses exhibit receptor binding domain (RBD) conservation and utilize the same host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for virus entry. Therefore, it will be important to test the cross-reactivity of antibodies that have been previously generated against the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV in order to aid research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that an immunogenic domain in the S2 subunit of SARS-CoV S is highly conserved in multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2. Consistently, four murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against this immunogenic SARS-CoV fragment were able to recognise the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 expressed in a mammalian cell line. Importantly, one of them (mAb 1A9) was demonstrated to detect S in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that mAbs targeting the S2 domain of SARS-CoV can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 and this observation is consistent with the high sequence conservation in the S2 subunit. These cross-reactive mAbs may serve as tools useful for SARS-CoV-2 research as well as for the development of diagnostic assays for its associated coronavirus disease COVID-19.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zheng, Zhong</author><author>Wu, Ke</author><author>Yao, Zhixian</author><author>Zheng, Junhua</author><author>Chen, Jian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Prediction for Development of COVID-19 in Global Major Epidemic Areas Through Empirical Trends in China by Utilizing State Transition Matrix Model</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.10.20033670</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.10.20033670</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: Since pneumonia caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, tremendous infected cases has risen all over the world attributed to high transmissibility. We managed to mathematically forecast the inflection point (IFP) of new cases in South Korea, Italy, and Iran, utilizing the transcendental model from Hubei and non-Hubei in China. Methods: We extracted data from reports released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (Dec 31, 2019 to Mar 5, 2020) and World Health Organization (Jan 20, 2020 to Mar 5, 2020) as the training set to deduce the arrival of the IFP of new cases in Hubei and non-Hubei on subsequent days and the data from Mar 6 to Mar 9 as validation set. New close contacts, newly confirmed cases, cumulative confirmed cases, non-severe cases, severe cases, critical cases, cured cases, and death data were collected and analyzed. Using this state transition matrix model, the horizon of the IFP of time (the rate of new increment reaches zero) could be predicted in South Korean, Italy, and Iran. Also, through this model, the global trend of the epidemic will be decoded to allocate international medical resources better and instruct the strategy for quarantine. Results: the optimistic scenario (non-Hubei model, daily increment rate of -3.87%), the relative pessimistic scenario (Hubei model, daily increment rate of -2.20%), and the relatively pessimistic scenario (adjustment, daily increment rate of -1.50%) were inferred and modeling from data in China. Matching and fitting with these scenarios, the IFP of time in South Korea would be Mar 6-Mar 12, Italy Mar 10-Mar 24, and Iran is Mar 10-Mar 24. The numbers of cumulative confirmed patients will reach approximately 20k in South Korea, 209k in Italy, and 226k in Iran under fitting scenarios, respectively. There should be room for improvement if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the IFP will arrive earlier than our estimation. However, with the adoption of different diagnosis criteria, the variation of new cases could impose various influences in the predictive model. If that happens, the IFP of increment will be higher than predicted above. Conclusion: We can affirm that the end of the burst of the epidemic is still inapproachable, and the number of confirmed cases is still escalating. With the augment of data, the world epidemic trend could be further predicted, and it is imperative to consummate the assignment of global medical resources to manipulate the development of COVID-19.

Much about this outbreak is still unknown. At this early stage of the epidemic, it is important to investigate alternative sources of information to understand its dynamics and spread. With updated real time domestic traffic, this study aims to integrate recent evidence of international evacuees extracted from Wuhan between Jan. 29 and Feb. 2, 2020 to infer the dynamics of the COVD-19 outbreak in Wuhan. In addition, a modified SEIR model was used to evaluate the empirical support for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. Based on the data examined, this study found little evidence for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. However, it is still too early to rule out its presence conclusively due to sample size and other limitations. The updated basic reproductive number was found to be 2.12 on average with a 95% credible interval of [2.04, 2.18]. It is smaller than previous estimates probably because the new estimate factors in the social and non-pharmaceutical mitigation implemented in Wuhan through the evacuee dataset. Detailed predictions of infected individuals exported both domestically and internationally were produced. The estimated case confirmation rate has been low but has increased steadily to 23.37% on average. The findings of this study depend on the validity of the underlying assumptions, and continuing work is needed, especially in monitoring the current infection status of Wuhan residents. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement No funding was received for this study. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. METHODS In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (≥18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. FINDINGS 191 patients (135 from Jinyintan Hospital and 56 from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital) were included in this study, of whom 137 were discharged and 54 died in hospital. 91 (48%) patients had a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common (58 [30%] patients), followed by diabetes (36 [19%] patients) and coronary heart disease (15 [8%] patients). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1·10, 95% CI 1·03-1·17, per year increase; p=0·0043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5·65, 2·61-12·23; p&lt;0·0001), and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/L (18·42, 2·64-128·55; p=0·0033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20·0 days (IQR 17·0-24·0) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. INTERPRETATION The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/L could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.

This virus epidemic quickly became a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model. Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created. Cumulation number of patients at the end of period 1 (day50) is 2868.7 ± 1739.0. Total infected patients could be 913396.5 ± 559099.9 by the end of period 2 (day70) in free transmission state. And at day90, total patients number is 913396.5 ± 559099.9. Conclusion: COVID-19 is a novel severe respiratory disease. This will put great burden on the shoulder of healthcare workers as well as on medical hardware and supplements. Current strict control measures help to contain disease from spreading. An early detecting, reporting and fast reacting system needs to be setup to prevent future unknown infectious disease. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement no funding ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for HCoV-19, the origins of the virus remain unclear. Here, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified from a metagenomics analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from Yunnan Province in China between May and October, 2019. RmYN02 shared 93.3% nucleotide identity with HCoV-19 at the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene in which it was the closest relative of HCoV-19. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to HCoV-19 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, however, and in a similar manner to HCoV-19, RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the Spike (S) protein. This provides strong evidence that such insertion events can occur in nature. Together, these data suggest that HCoV-19 originated from multiple naturally occurring recombination events among those viruses present in bats and other wildlife species.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, L</author><author>Liu, H G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[Early detection and disease assessment of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia]</title><secondary-title>Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi</full-title></periodical><pages>E003</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>0</issue><edition>2020/02/06</edition><keywords><keyword>2019 novel coronavirus</keyword><keyword>Antiviral therapy</keyword><keyword>Infection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><isbn>1001-0939 (Print)1001-0939</isbn><accession-num>32023686</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.3760/cma.j.issn.1001-0939.2020.0003</electronic-resource-num><notes>Zhou, L

Importantly, we have confirmed that this novel CoV uses the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Qiang</author><author>Yan, Renhong</author><author>Zhang, Yuanyuan</author><author>Li, Yaning</author><author>Xia, Lu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Structure of dimeric full-length human ACE2 in complex with B0AT1</title><secondary-title>bioRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>bioRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.17.951848</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.17.951848</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the surface receptor for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) through interaction with its spike glycoprotein (S protein). ACE2 is also suggested to be the receptor for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is causing a serious epidemic in China manifested with severe respiratory syndrome. BAT1 (SLC6A19) is a neutral amino acid transporter whose surface expression in intestinal cells requires ACE2. Here we present the 2.9 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 in complex with BAT1. The complex, assembled as a dimer of ACE2-BAT1 heterodimers, exhibits open and closed conformations due to the shifts of the peptidase domains of ACE2. A newly resolved Collectrin-like domain (CLD) on ACE2 mediates homo-dimerization. The extended TM7 in each BAT1 clamps CLD of ACE2. Structural analysis suggests that the ACE2-BAT1 complex can bind two S proteins simultaneously, providing important clues to the molecular basis for coronavirus recognition and infection.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Tao</author><author>Liu, Quanhui</author><author>Yang, Zimo</author><author>Liao, Jingyi</author><author>Yang, Kexin</author><author>Bai, Wei</author><author>6#, Lu</author><author>Zhang, Wei</author><author>Biomedical, West China</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preliminary prediction of the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV</title><secondary-title>arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.10530</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.10530</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)</keyword><keyword>basic reproduction number</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;reviewed</label><abstract>Objectives: To estimate the basic reproduction number of the Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Methods: Based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model and the assumption that the infectious cases with symptoms occurred before 26 January, 2020 are resulted from free propagation without intervention, we estimate the basic reproduction number of 2019-nCoV according to the reported confirmed cases and suspected cases, as well as the theoretical estimated number of infected cases by other research teams, together with some epidemiological determinants learned from the severe acute respiratory syndrome. Results: The basic reproduction number fall between 2.8 to 3.3 by using the real-time reports on the number of 2019-nCoV infected cases from People's Daily in China and fall between 3.2 and 3.9 on the basis of the predicted number of infected cases from international colleagues. Using a newly reported epidemiological determinants for early 2019-nCoV, the estimated basic reproduction number is in the range [2.2,3.0]. Conclusions: The early transmission ability of 2019-nCoV is close to or slightly higher than SARS. It is a controllable disease with moderate-high transmissibility. Timely and effective control measures are needed to suppress the further transmissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Xinkai</author><author>Wu, Zhigui</author><author>Yu, Ranran</author><author>Cao, Shanni</author><author>Fang, Wen</author><author>Jiang, Zhen</author><author>Yuan, Fang</author><author>Yan, Chao</author><author>Chen, Dijun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modelling-based evaluation of the effect of quarantine control by the Chinese government in the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.03.03.20030445</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.03.03.20030445</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url><url>internal-pdf://Zhou et al. - 2020 - Modelling-based evaluation of the effect of quarantine control by the Chinese government in the coronavirus disease.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>biorxiv;coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, which was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has rapidly spread all over China and across the world. By the end of February 2020, the epidemic outside Hubei province in China has been well controlled, yet the next wave of transmission in other countries may have just begun. A retrospective modeling of the transmission dynamics would provide insights into the epidemiological characteristics of the disease and evaluation of the effectiveness of the strict measures that have been taken by central and local governments of China. Using a refined susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission model and a new strategy of model fitting, we were able to estimate model parameters in a dynamic manner. The resulting parameter estimation can well reflect the prevention policy scenarios. Our simulation results with different degrees of government control suggest that the strictly enforced quarantine and travel ban have significantly decreased the otherwise uncontrollable spread of the disease. Our results suggest similar measures should be considered by other countries that are of high risk of COVID-19 outbreak. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement The National Natural Science Foundation of China (21877060) ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and known HCoV-host interactions in the human protein-protein interactome, we computationally identified 135 putative repurposable drugs for the potential prevention and treatment of HCoVs. In addition, we prioritized 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (including melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that were further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. Finally, we showcased three potential drug combinations (including sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the Complementary Exposure pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human protein-protein interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations toward future clinical trials for HCoVs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementNAAuthor DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Wuhan is the disaster area, where the number of cases has increased rapidly. However, the current measures of infected patients in Wuhan are still underestimated. Objective: To estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan from several sampled data. The correct estimated infected patients can be helpful for the government to arrange the needed beds in hospital wards to meet the actual needs. Design: We proposed to use the sampling survey to estimate the overall infected patients in Wuhan. The sampling survey is a kind of non-comprehensive survey. It selected some units from all the survey objects to carry out the survey and made the estimation and inference to all the survey objects. Sampling surveys can obtain information that reflects the overall situation, although it is not a comprehensive survey. Setting: We estimated the overall infection rate in Wenzhou city, which has a better data collection system. Simultaneously, another different samples of Wuhan tourists to Singapore will be used to validate the infection rate in Wenzhou city. Combined these two samples, we give the estimation of the number of infected patients in Wuhan and other prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province. Participants: The number of people who returned from Wuhan to Wenzhou was selected from the daily notification of the pneumonia epidemic caused by a new coronavirus infection in the city. Exposures for observational studies: The daily rate of the pneumonia epidemic caused by the new coronavirus infection in Wenzhou City. The numerator is the number of people diagnosed and whether each person diagnosed had a history of living in Wuhan. The denominator is the total number of people returning to Wenzhou from Wuhan. Based on this rate, it is reasonable to predict the number of the infected patients.

Recently, a severe pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome caused by a new coronavirus was reported at December 2019 (2019-nCoV) in the city Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which was also named as pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome (PARS). Up to 9th of February 2020, at least 37, 251 cases have been reported with 812 fatal cases according to the report from China CDC. However, the immune mechanism that potential orchestrated acute mortality from patients of 2019-nCoV is still unknown. Here we show that after the 2019-nCoV infection, CD4+, T lymphocytes are rapidly activated to become pathogenic T helper (Th) 1 cells and generate GM-CSF etc. The cytokines environment induces inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes with high expression of IL-6 and accelerates the inflammation. These aberrant and excessive immune cells may enter the pulmonary circulation in huge numbers and play an immune damaging role to causing lung functional disability and quick mortality. Our results demonstrate that excessive non-effective host immune responses by pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes may associate with severe lung pathology. Therefore, we suggest that monoclonal antibody that targets the GM-CSF or interleukin 6 receptor may potentially curb immunopathology caused by 2019-nCoV and consequently win more time for virus clearance.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Yunyun</author><author>Zeng, Yuyang</author><author>Tong, Yongqing</author><author>Chen, ChangZheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ophthalmologic evidence against the interpersonal transmission of 2019 novel coronavirus through conjunctiva</title><secondary-title>medRxiv</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>medRxiv</full-title></periodical><pages>2020.02.11.20021956</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1101/2020.02.11.20021956</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls></urls><label>coronavirus;medrxiv;reviewed</label><abstract>Background: The emerging 2019 novel coronavirus (2019−nCoV) has pushed several countries into state of emergency all over the world. The possible transmission of 2019−nCoV by conjunctiva is controversial and has substantial public health implications. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was initiated to investigate the possible transmission of 2019−nCoV through aerosol contact with conjunctiva. We enrolled 67 cases of confirmed or suspected cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) during 17−28 Jan 2020. Nasopharyngeal and conjunctival swabs were collected for real time RT-PCR analysis to detect 2019−nCoV. Results: 63 patients were identified as laboratory−confirmed NCP and the remaining four were suspected NCP. Conjunctival swab samples from one NCP patient yielded positive PCR results and two NCP patients yielded probable positive PCR results. None of the three patients had ocular symptoms. The only one NCP patient with conjunctivitis as the first symptom had negative conjunctival sac 2019−nCoV test. Conjunctival swab samples from the four suspected cases of NCIP were negative. Conclusion: 2019−nCoV can be detected in the conjunctival sac of patients with NCP. Through clinical analysis, viral transmission via the conjunctival route was not supported by the data. Good clinical protection can effectively cut off the transmission path.

A systematic profiling of the immune vulnerability landscape of 2019-nCoV is lacking, which can bring critical insights into the immune clearance mechanism, peptide vaccine development, and antiviral antibody development. In this study, we predicted the potential of all the 2019-nCoV viral proteins to induce class I and II MHC presentation and form linear antibody epitopes. We showed that the enrichment for T cell and B cell epitopes is not uniform on the viral genome, with several focused regions that generate abundant epitopes and may be more targetable. We showed that genetic variations in 2019-nCoV, though fewer for the moment, already follow the pattern of mutations in related coronaviruses, and could alter the immune vulnerability landscape of this virus, which should be considered in the development of therapies. We create an online database to broadly share our research outcome. Overall, we present an immunological resource for 2019-nCoV that could significantly promote both therapeutic development and mechanistic research.</abstract></record><record><database name="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl" path="mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl">mendeley_document_library_2020-03-25.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhu, Na</author><author>Zhang, Dingyu</author><author>Wang, Wenling</author><author>Li, Xinwang</author><author>Yang, Bo</author><author>Song, Jingdong</author><author>Zhao, Xiang</author><author>Huang, Baoying</author><author>Shi, Weifeng</author><author>Lu, Roujian</author><author>Niu, Peihua</author><author>Zhan, Faxian</author><author>Ma, Xuejun</author><author>Wang, Dayan</author><author>Xu, Wenbo</author><author>Wu, Guizhen</author><author>Gao, George F.</author><author>Tan, Wenjie</author><author>China Novel Coronavirus, Investigating</author><author>Research, Team</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China, 2019</title><secondary-title>New England Journal of Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>New England Journal of Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>NEJMoa2001017</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><accession-num>31978945</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1056/NEJMoa2001017</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China, 2019 - Zhu, Na; Zhang, Dingyu; Wang, Wenling; Li, Xinwang; Yang, Bo; Song, Jingdong; Zhao, Xiang; Huang, Baoying; Shi, Weifeng; Lu, Roujian; Niu, Peihua; Zhan, Faxian; Ma, Xuejun; Wang, Dayan; Xu, Wenbo; Wu, Guizhen; Gao, George F; Tan, Wenjie; China Novel Coronavirus, Investigating; Research, Team)

But, there is still a lack of systematic review of registered clinical trials. Therefore, we made the first systematic review of the clinical trials of COVID-19 in order to provide evidence for the control of the COVID-19. Methods: The database from the Chinese Clinical Registration Center and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched to collect the registered clinical trials of COVID-19. The retrieval inception date is February 9, 2020. Two evaluators independently selected literature, extracted data and evaluated the risk of bias. This study is based on the recommendations of PRISMA in Cochrane handbook. Results: A total of 75 COVID-19 registered clinical trials (63 interventional studies and 12 observational studies) were obtained. 97.3% of clinical trials were initiated by Chinese organizations. Only 11 trials have begun to recruit patients, and all registered clinical trials have not been completed. Most of the trials are early clinical exploratory trials or in pre-experiment stage (only two trials of Remdesivir in Ⅲ stage), and the sample size of subjects recruited is small. The main intervention methods include traditional Chinese medicine treatment, western medicine treatment and integrated Chinese and Western medicine treatment. The subjects were mainly non severe adult patients (≥ 18 years old). The main outcomes were clinical observation and examination. The duration of most trials was more than 5 months, and the median of the intervention study was 180 d (95% CI: 146.3 - 328.9 d); the median of the observation period was 334 d (95% CI: 166.6 - 363.4 d). Overall, both the methodology quality of intervention register trials and observational trials are low. Conclusions: Disorderly and intensive clinical trials of COVID-19 using traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine are ongoing or will be carried out in China. However, based on the poor quality and small sample size and long completion period, we will not be able to obtain reliable, high-quality clinical evidence about COVID-19 treatment for quite a long time in the future. Improving the quality of study design, prioritizing promising drugs, and using different designs and statistical methods are worth advocating and recommending for the clinical trials of COVID-19 in China. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Clinical Trial No applicable. ### Funding Statement No external funding was received. ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

The aim of this study is to model the current dynamics of 2019-nCoV at city level and predict the trend in the next 30 days under three possible scenarios in mainland China. We developed a spatially explicit epidemic model to consider the unique characteristics of the virus transmission in individual cities. Our model considered that the rate of virus transmission among local residents is different from those with Wuhan travel history due to the self-isolation policy. We introduced a decay rate to quantify the effort of each city to gradually control the disease spreading. We used mobile phone data to obtain the number of individuals in each city who have travel history to Wuhan. This city-level model was trained using confirmed cases up to February 10, 2020 and validated by new confirmed cases on February 11, 2020. We used the trained model to predict the future dynamics up to March 12, 2020 under different scenarios: the current trend maintained, control efforts expanded, and person-to-person contact increased due to work resuming. We estimated that the total infections in mainland China would be 72172, 54348, and 149774 by March 12, 2020 under each scenario respectively. Under the current trend, all cities will show the peak point of daily new infections by February 21. This date can be advanced to February 14 with control efforts expanded or postponed to February 26 under pressure of work resuming. Except Wuhan that cannot eliminate the disease by March 12, our model predicts that 95.4%, 100%, and 75.7% cities will have no new infections by the end of February under three scenarios. The spatial pattern of our prediction could help the government allocate resources to cities that have a more serious epidemic in the next 30 days. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement This research received no external funding ### Author Declarations All relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.

BACKGROUND During epidemic period, chest computed tomography (CT) has been highly recommended for screening patients with suspected COVID-19. However, the comparison of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia has not been fully elucidated. METHODS Patients with heart failure (n=12), COVID-19 pneumonia (n=12) and one patient with both diseases were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical information and imaging of chest CT were collected and analyzed. RESULTS There was no difference of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, crazy paving pattern, lobes affected and septal thickening between heart failure and COVID-19 pneumonia. However, less rounded morphology (8.3% vs. 67%, p=0.003), more peribronchovascular thickening (75% vs. 33%, p=0.041) and fissural thickening (33% vs. 0%, p=0.028), less peripheral distribution (33% vs. 92%, p=0.003) were found in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group. Importantly, there were also more patients with upper pulmonary vein enlargement (75% vs. 8.3%, p=0.001), subpleural effusion and cardiac enlargement in heart failure group than that in COVID-19 group (50% vs. 0%, p=0.005, separately). Besides, more fibrous lesions were found in COVID-19 group although there was no statistical difference (25% vs. 0%, P=0.064) CONCLUSIONS Although there are some overlaps of CT imaging between heart failure and COVID-19, CT is still a useful tool in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia.

With the urgent needs to assist the control of the Coronavirus spread and to provide valuable scientific information, we developed a coronavirus database (CoVdb), an online genomics and proteomics analysis platform. Based on public available coronavirus genomic information, the database annotates the genome of every strain and identifies 780 possible ORFs of all strains available in Genebank. In addition, the comprehensive evaluation of all the published genomes of Coronavirus strains, including population genetics analysis, functional analysis and structural analysis on a historical and global scale were presented in the CoVdb. In the database, the researcher can easily obtain the basic information of a Coronavirus gene with the distribution of the gene among strains, conserved or high mutation regions, possible subcellular location and topology of the gene. Moreover, sliding windows for population genetics analysis results is provided, thereby facilitating genetics and evolutional analysis at the genomic level.

We aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the effect of psychological protective measures taken by Tongji Hospital. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. RESULTS: We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1 percent). 1509 (29.8 percent), 681 (13.5 percent) and 1218 (24.1 percent) HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (hazard ratio[HR], 1.31; P=0.032), years of working&gt; 10 years (HR, 2.02; P&lt;0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (HR, 1.51; P&lt;0.001), history of mental disorders (HR, 3.27; P&lt;0.001), and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (HR, 1.23; P=0.030) were risk factors for stress, whereas care provided by hospital and department administrators(odds ratio [OR], 0.76; P=0.024) and full coverage of all departments with protective measures (OR, 0.69; P=0.004) were protective factors. CONCLUSIONS: Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological protective measures implemented by the hospital could be helpful.

The emergence of this virus coincided with the Spring Festival Travel Rush in China. It is possible to estimate total number of cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan, by 23 January 2020, given the cases reported in other cities and population flow data between cities. Methods: We built a model to estimate the total number of cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on the number of cases detected outside Wuhan city in China, with the assumption that if the same screening effort used in other cities applied in Wuhan. We employed population flow data from different sources between Wuhan and other cities/regions by 23 January 2020. The number of total cases was determined by the maximum log likelihood estimation. Findings: From overall cities/regions data, we predicted 1326 (95% CI: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% CI: 1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% CI: 4732, 5859) as total cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different source of data from Changjiang Daily newspaper, Tencent, and Baidu. From separate cities/regions data, we estimated 1059 (95% CI: 918, 1209), 5214 (95% CI: 4659, 5808) as total cases in Wuhan in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different sources of population flow data from Tencent and Baidu. Conclusion: Sources of population follow data and methods impact the estimates of local cases in Wuhan before city lock down. Keyword: COVID-19; mobility; pneumonia; transportation; outbreaks

We modeled the transmission process in Republic of Korea and Italy with a stochastic model and estimated the basic reproduction number R0 as 2.6 (95% CI: 2.3-2.9) or 3.2 (95% CI: 2.9-3.5) in Republic of Korea, under the assumption that the exponential growth starting on 31 January or 5 February 2020, and 2.6 (95% CI: 2.3-2.9) or 3.3 (95% CI: 3.0-3.6) in Italy, under the assumption that the exponential growth starting on 5 February or 10 February 2020. Estimates of dispersion term (k) were 10 (95% CI: 5-56) or 22 (95% CI: 8-61) in Republic of Korea, and 13 (95% CI: 5-61) or 37 (95% CI: 13-61) in Italy, and all of which imply few super-spreading events. ### Competing Interest Statement DH was supported by an Alibaba-Hong Kong Polytechnic University Collaborative Research project.

The classic epidemiological approach in studying this growth is to quantify a reproduction number and infection time, and this is the approach followed by many studies on the epidemiology of this disease. However, this assumption leads to exponential growth, and while the growth rate is high, it is not following exponential behavior. One approach that is being used is to simply keep adjusting the reproduction number to match the dynamics. Other approaches use rate equations such as the SEIR and logistical models. Here we show that the current growth closely follows power-law kinetics, indicative of an underlying fractal or small-world network of connections between susceptible and infected individuals. Positive deviations from this growth law might indicate either a failure of the current containment efforts while negative deviations might indicate the beginnings of the end of the pandemic. We cannot predict the ultimate extent of the pandemic but can get an estimate of the growth of the disease.
